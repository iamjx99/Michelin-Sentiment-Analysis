Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,3,2-Feb-24,3,"My husband and I had dinner at Alain Ducasse to close out our short trip in London. No disrespect, but Alain Ducasse was our second choice after we found out that Clare Smyth's restaurant was booked up.

For our experience at Alain Ducasse, the service was top-notch. The food was artfully executed but not palatable to our taste. I felt the same way at The French Laundry (Yountville, CA) and Kashiwaya (Osaka, Japan). Unfortunately, you don't always have a great meal at a 3-star Michelin restaurant.

1st course: This was my favorite of the entire tasting menu. A lovely scallop dish topped with Kristal caviar and beurre balance sauce was the perfect bite.

2nd course: A cauliflower-hazelnut dish created with seasonal ingredients but just tasted very mid.

3rd course: Lobster was slightly overcooked.

4th course: Turbot was perfectly prepared. It was delicious, but I have to say I barely tasted the sea urchin.

5th course: Venison, also perfectly prepared and delicious.

At this point, nothing really blew me away. Everything tasted good but not amazing.

The next 2 courses were dessert courses and, as expected, were not exciting.

6th course: This course included 3 types of cheeses, one being particularly pungent. While I do enjoy some cheeses, I find myself unable to appreciate stinky cheese.

7th course: The final course was a green apple sorbet of sorts, sorry to put it so simply. It was very, very tart, but not bad.

Since we were celebrating an anniversary, the chef sent us a baba au rhum, which was very kind of him/her.

Alain Ducasse is such a culinary legend, and I really wanted to like his food, but I just didn't. I'm very sorry to say this tasting menu was not very fun."
Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,3,3-Jan-24,1,"They are not accommodating. They don't care , they just want your money. I flew in from London and I arrived sick, I had severe motion sickness and dehydrated. I called to cancel my reservation since I was so sick and told them if I end up going there, I would throw up. They didn't care about my health. They charged me 500 pounds for cancelling. I should have showed up and just thrown up at the restaurant!! They don't care about you at all!!"
Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,3,1-Dec-23,5,This was my first 3 Michelin star experience in London and I wanted to make sure I picked one that had been there the longest. When we sat down someone greeted us right away and then it took about 10 minutes for anyone to come back over. That was the only hiccup during the whole evening but all the food with the presentation and flavor was excellent. It is one of those restaurants that you need to check off the list. Definitely give it a try if your able to score a reservation.
Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,3,9-Oct-23,3,"Very difficult! A three star Michelin restaurant. Expectations are high. One spends a few thousand dollars or a few thousand pounds for not only the experience but heavenly food. While the food was good and the service was good...it was not mind blowing by any stretch of the imagination. Everyone was disappointed.

The staff was courteous and did their roles. I was wearing a black suit, they only had white napkins which I have not seen before. Possible white lint on a black suit is why I always have seen different colored napkins available. There were times where one wine glass was different from the others. Thought that was odd. A little sloppy.

They were very good at planning menu options for anyone with allergies.

The food did seem to have an over citrus flavor theme throughout. Not a big citrus fan. So I personally had a problem. There was one dish that features a small bit of sardines to add variety of flavor. Seemed very poorly executed. Was not spread evenly to give the full consistent taste. One bite had none. Another bite that sardine is all I tasted and another was perfect. The steak dish had no flavor at all. Even a little salt would have helped.

We enjoyed the cream that came with the caviar, scallop and the lobster dish the most. Most of the dishes were not memorable.

I would not come back here. Once again there are so many good options available."
Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,3,14-Sep-23,5,"Dining at an Alain Ducasse establishment is always a transcendent experience, and this restaurant was no exception. The attention to detail is palpable from the moment you walk in -- the ambiance is both luxurious and welcoming. The menu is a symphony of flavors, each dish showcasing Ducasse's commitment to culinary excellence. The staff was impeccable in their service, ensuring our evening was flawless. A special mention to the sommelier, whose wine pairings elevated each course to perfection. This is more than just a meal, it's a journey. Highly recommended for those seeking an unparalleled dining experience."
Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,3,20-Jul-23,5,"The waiters are beyond helpful and communicative. Our waiter was so wonderful that when I asked how the kitchens were run, he brought us back to the kitchens to meet the chef.

As for the food, it starts and ends with the lobster dish. It was the absolute best. The scallop dish was also phenomenal. My husband jokingly told the waiter it was the second best scallop he'd ever had... Not sure why my husband said that, but rest assured, it was the best scallop.

The ambience was nice and open so you were not close to any other tables, and had privacy in conversation.

We also liked that they offered wine in half bottles, as often a full bottle is too much.

Excellent evening."
Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,3,15-Apr-23,1,"I called from my hotel JW Marriott and was told that I could come by. One of the 3 all-white female hosts saw my Asian face told me to wait so that she could check. She took a while to go inside and came out to tell me that there was no seat available and told me to check with the Chinese restaurant next door!

If you are an Asian, you should avoid this racist restaurant!"
Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,3,16-Aug-22,5,"In pictures and in words, I cannot do this experience justice.

The name Alain Ducasse guarantees that the food will be perfection (and indeed it was). We thought we were going to enjoy a three course lunch and maybe some bread, but we got to sample so many lovely surprises along the way! From the richly flavorful canapes to an exquisite amuse bouche to the post-dessert treats (the leaf-thin chocolate pastries alone would justify a revisit) we enjoyed the most precise, perfected flavors from sour to savory to sweet. The (included!) glasses of red and white wine were a lovely touch that surely contributed to our ascent to culinary heaven.

We've tried and loved many a bread-and-butter but we've reached a new peak with the delightful bread trolley, an incredible (lemony?) whipped curd and fluffy homemade butter.

And needless to say, the lunch itself was delicious. My soft boiled egg with radish in chicken jus was the best I'll ever eat, a meticulously arranged harmony of textures and appetizing acidity. The homemade agnolotti was filled with bursts of unidentifiably otherworldly savory flavor. My mom thought her fillet of lemon sole with sweetcorn was life-changing - who knew corn could taste so good!?

My chocolate / hazelnut praline / caramel dessert is the glittering standard to which all desserts should be held. A flawless marriage of textures, temperatures, and nuttiness that filled my tastebuds with overwhelming freshness (not sweetness), bringing out the best of each of its ingredients. I have never loved a dessert more and I think the only thing that will come close is a second serving :-)

Above and beyond the food itself, what made our experience today so magical was the service. From the minute we were ushered to our table, every detail was painstakingly thought through and the choreography of the meal cleanly executed; every person made us feel so comfortable and truly taken care of. For the hospitality alone, Alain Ducasse is unforgettable and unparalleled.

I've literally run out of caption space but this has been our best dining experience to date: this is everything fine dining should be.

Dined: August 25, 2021"
Alain Ducasse at The Dorchester,3,25-Mar-22,5,"Alain Ducasse restaurants never disappoint. They have a standard that is top level. The three Star experience at the dorchester is more relaxed than the paris restaurants which is nice. Dim quiet interior. Helpful staff. They treat you great. As they should for the price. Extensive drink menu and knowledgeable sommelier. Started with a gin martini and then to wine. The meal is obviously very elevated. My stars where the first few dishes. The Jerusalem artichoke was amazing. And the trio of cauliflower was inspired. The new builds to a surprisingly refreshing dessert. I enjoyed that. After such a decadent meal I don't need a heavy sweet. But, if you have a sweet tooth don't worry they give you plenty of chocolate. If I am being nit picky and hyper hyper critical, I wish the later dishes packed more of a punch and I wish the beef was seared a bit more. That is a pretty minor thing. Perfect place for a birthday or anniversary."
CORE by Clare Smyth,3,26-Apr-24,5,"Honestly, this is one of my most memorable and amazing meals that I've had. A 3 star Michelin restaurant with a chef whom is consistently present with her staff and has the passion and empathy to say hi to her guests while making her menu financially accessible to more people considering the status of her food.

It was a genuine pleasure to be serviced by the waiting staff and chefs. Clare Smyth is a major reason to visit, but her staff and their warmth and professionalism is on another level of service. Genuinely, it broke my mind the way we were treated.

I ordered the classic menu while my date had the seasonal spring menu. We also ordered a bottle of wine!

Overall, cannot say enough amazing things about my experience here."
CORE by Clare Smyth,3,26-Jul-23,5,"Took my wife here to celebrate our first big trip since the pandemic. From start to finish the experience was extraordinary.

Clare Smyth's cuisine and service embody excellence across the board, and truly she is one of England's greatest chefs.

Booking was by the numbers. While you have to be ready to get a table when released, thankfully, it was not impossible.

We took the tube to Notting Hill, and it was a pleasant walk to the restaurant through some lovely neighborhoods. Upon checking in we were greeted warmly and taken to our table.

Two tasting menus were offered - the classic tasting menu and the ""Core Seasons."" We got one of each, why not try each dish? We also got a wine pairing.

We prepared our palates with some champagne and cocktails, and sat back to enjoy the experience. Each dish was a breathtaking melange of color, expertly arranged and plated. The flavors and how all the ingredients were sublime.

The wait staff were very knowledgeable about all the wines served and we enjoyed their stories of the provenances of each vintage.

On the way out we got to meet Clare and thanked her for a wonderful evening we would not forget."
CORE by Clare Smyth,3,10-Jul-23,5,"If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. My bf and I have a few shows we watch together, Top Chef being one of them. So when I saw a reservation for lunch open for this restaurant while we were on vacation, I knew I had to book it.

We traveled by metro to the restaurant and got there a little early. The hostess was very gracious and let us store our bags in the front closet. We had the earliest reservation, so there we were quite outnumbered by the wait staff. Once the restaurant filled up a bit more, I watched in wonder at a well-oiled machine. Everything from the escort to the restroom, to pulling out chairs, to describing every single dish was impeccable.

Now, the food, every single dish, was delicious, well balanced, and presented like an absolute work of art. We started with 3 pieces of amuse bouche to get our palates ready, and my palate was still not ready! The scallop tartare has probably ruined me. I don't know how, if or why I would ever eat scallops after this. To say they were fresh would be an understatement. Potato and Roe, every time I go to a fine dining restaurant, I am always amazed by all of the flavors they can put into a modest food such as a potato. The roasted cod was delicious. The lamb carrot was quite a surprise as the carrot was magically stuffed with roasted lamb. The venison was very tender and juicy. The Core Apple was magical, as it looks like a fuji apple but is a delicious stuffed mousse. The Wild Strawberry is also a beautiful optical illusion as it represents a caprese salad but is a refreshing dessert.

Just when I thought I couldn't fit in another morsel, here comes the Petit Fours. With my second stomach that's usually reserved for desserts, I managed to devour a chocolate tart that was reminiscent of a fresh baked cookie and their wonderful jellied wine. This reminded me of a super potent wine jello shot but way more refined.

I can not recommend trying to secure a reservation to this restaurant if you're on vacation and want to splurge on a Three Michelin Star meal."
CORE by Clare Smyth,3,26-Jun-23,1,"I booked for 2 people for Core Restaurant at 9.45pm, my plane was delayed by over an hour to return to London, so I asked the restaurant and asked the attendant if I could change my booking or come half an hour late. She said she could change my booking but will charge me a cancellation fee or keep my booking for half an hour. I received an email prior to half an hour to say I will be charged $300GPD cancellation fee and they stoped picking up my calls. It's disgusting!"
CORE by Clare Smyth,3,24-May-23,5,What an amazing experience we had. This review is a bit late as we were there in October 22'.. You walk in and immediately you are transported. We were lucky to snag an afternoon lunch resv. Which was absolutely perfect time. The sun coming through the restaurant.. the food was just so beautiful .... next couple of hours were pure joy ...all the senses engaged. Can't wait to come back to see what's next..
CORE by Clare Smyth,3,8-Jan-23,5,"Words can't describe what a beautiful, delicious, and perfect experience our dinner was. As soon as you enter the door, to every minute of the well choreographed dinner to our departure - perfection. There is an abundance of staff and one has to admire the level of efficiency of the staff's movements around the dining room. A finished plate never sat on the table for more than 30 seconds before someone came to whisk it away and clean the table. Each dish was presented perfectly and staff was knowledgeable and energetic to present the next course. The dishes were phenomenal tasting. The creativity, beauty, and just overall taste of each and every dish. Nothing was heavy, while most dishes were quite bright. The desserts were just ok but the rest of the meal more than made up for it.
Chef was in the kitchen and was able to even get a quick greeting on the way in and out. Would come back in a heartbeat."
CORE by Clare Smyth,3,11-Nov-22,5,"Set your alarms to get reservations because they get booked quick! I was fortunate enough to get reservations about 2 months out for our trip to London for a birthday dinner. We were excited to dine here after seeing Chef Clare on Chef's Table on Netflix. Dining at Core was a wonderful experience. Our host grabbed us to get seated after we had a cocktail in the waiting area. Right when we entered the dining room, we saw Chef Clare and her friendly staff members waive and greet us with the most welcoming hello! I enjoyed her open kitchen layout to see the chefs hard at work.

We decided to pick one of each on the tasting menu so we can try a variety of Chef Clare's dishes. I love that we have the option of choosing different tasting menus when it was just us 2 dining. Typically, high end restaurants require you get the same tasting menu for the whole table since it's easier to prepare.

All of the dishes had it's own unique taste with a gorgeous presentation. The sauce for her signature potato dish was divine and the potato was cooked perfectly. Be prepared for a TON of dessert dishes. I wish they offered more savory compared to sweets. The staff was very knowledgeable and gave us a full description of each dish while serving us. I highly recommend giving this 3 Michelin Star restaurant a try!"
CORE by Clare Smyth,3,17-Oct-22,5,"Loved this restaurant and would definitely try to go back when I'm in london! I say try because reservations are hard to come by. There were two menus to choose from and we got one of each so that we could try everything! The classic tasting was fine, but between the two we both enjoyed the core seasons menu more. The service was great and although I was scared of finishing really late (our reservation was at 9/9:30) time surprisingly flew by quickly and I wasn't as tired as I thought I would be. Presentation was phenomenal as well!"
CORE by Clare Smyth,3,5-Oct-22,5,"I tried doing the no-reservations thing at CORE twice, back before the Covids, but they only ever had seating at the bar, not in the main dining room. Like an idiot, I passed, both times.

I was a little worried that a couple was allowed to enter with their baby, but the infant was seated far from my table, so, few worries. And now that I've finally been properly seated, I found the food, service, ambiance to be exceptional.

Of course, there are plenty of exceptional restaurants, worldwide. Here, I was very pleased to see that Chef Clare Smyth, who I believe to be one of only 4 women who have ever earned a third Michelin star, has selected her restaurant staff to include women and men of various diverse backgrounds, on both sides of house, at all levels. The kitchen (and staff) is fully visible to the patrons at the Chef's table, but every diner gets a glimpse as they walk by.

It is not until you've visited a handful of these super high-end restaurants to realize that Chef Smyth's diverse staff is extremely rare.

I'll have to return soon.

Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,3,3-May-24,4,"display and presentation are both great
service is fantastic.
Truely remarkable Michelin experience.
however, quite a few us suffered GI issue within hrs after the finish.
it was a pity"
Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,3,4-Jun-23,4,"We had not been since they used marbles on the menu for you to select your dishes. While that was cool, my wife had not been expecting it so we are glad they went back to the traditional menu approach.

The team was excellent and even humored us speaking in Italian to us at times (we are learning). We did the five course menu with the wagyu which was fantastic. The pairings were really nice throughout the meal and it was a really nice evening. The lobster was especially delicious and their take on onion soup was quite inventive.

This is definitely in our rotation and we will see how the menu evolves over time"
Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,3,31-Dec-22,4,"The dishes here are museum quality. Each one is a work of art. Service is excellent as is the setting. The taste is absent in some of the dishes. Some are a bit bland, and some are excellent. The wagyu beef was outstanding, like butter, but the 125 pound upcharge was outrageous. The baba rum also had an 18 pound upcharge for the 30-year-old brandy that was drizzled with. All in all our meal for two was over 500 pounds without any liquor."
Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,3,14-Dec-22,1,None of the 7 courses are tasty. Very mediocre! I really don't understand how can it get Michelin 3 stars. All 1 or 2 stars restaurants I tried were way better than this one
Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,3,11-Dec-22,5,"This was my first time eating a 3 Michelin star restaurant and wow I wasn't prepared for just how much of an upgrade the dining experience would be.

We opted for the full tasting menu with the wine pairing. Their menu is seasonal so I won't go into much detail about the food because it was all amazing and this review would be 10 pages long.

The level of service and attention to detail is truly astonishing. The staff were amazing and super friendly. A lot of times it can feel intimidating to sit down at such renowned place but they made it super comfortable. They also reached out beforehand and asked if we had a special reason for visiting the restaurant to which we said for our anniversary and they hand wrote a very nice card for us.

Even days after they emailed me and thanked us for our visit. Made our first night in London so special.

Thanks again!"
Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,3,14-Aug-22,5,My family and I have been fortunate enough to dine at the top Michelin restaurants around the world. This restaurant delivered sharp service and executed imaginative delectable dishes. We will be back for the chef's table and sommelier tasting when we return. Thank you for a memorable night and for entertaining our 8 year olds palate. She thoroughly enjoyed her creative mock-tails.
Hélène Darroze at The Connaught,3,6-Jul-22,5,"Instant contender for one of my top meals ever.

I can't say enough about our meal at HD.
It was top level dining from start to finish in all categories.

The ambience and service were fantastic and the food was world class.

Full disclosure, I had a couple of martinis at the hotel lobby bar (which is also fantastic) before dinner, so that plus the (generous and delicious) wine pairings started to make things a little fuzzy towards the dessert courses... but I can tell you with 100% certainty that despite that this was a night I won't soon forget.

I will spare you the dish by dish rundown but each course was an incredible display of technique, beauty, flavor and attention to detail.

I mentioned the service earlier, but it can't be overlooked how important they are to the overall experience and at HD they were attentive, knowledgable, friendly, fun, accommodating... I have run out of adjectives, but the staff was superb.

Hélène Darroze is playing in the top level culinary sandbox as a three Michelin star tasting menu restaurant and they have proved to me that they can go up against any meal in the world.
They nailed it.
We were blown away.
"
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,8-Jul-24,5,"First of all, from the outside, the restaurant looks very unassuming, almost like a house or apartment building door that you could easily miss. But when you walk in, it feels like you are entering a mysterious room. Then you see the smiling faces of the staff.

We were seated right away. The dining room was very intimate with elegant decor and a quiet atmosphere--I could barely hear the other diners, just a whispering noise. When we received the menu, they explained that there were three options: the surprise option and two others where you know what you are getting. They also checked with us about any allergies.

Throughout the meal, I kept thinking about how the staff brought food to the different tables with such etiquette. They would walk to the doorframe for their boss to check the food before bringing it to the tables, placing all the plates in front of each customer simultaneously. It reminded me of the movie ""The Menu,"" but in a good way.

My son and I chose the surprise menu, while my daughter opted for the six-course meal. We received tiny portions of food with amazing flavors. Initially, we thought we might leave hungry, but by the end of the experience, we were in a very pleasant food coma.

This is definitely an experience that will stay with me for the rest of my life, and I am for sure coming back the next time I am in London. It was worth every penny. Thank you, Gordon Ramsay, for this amazing restaurant. Thank you to the chef for the incredible taste and presentation of the food, and last but not least, thank you to all the staff who made it such a special day!

See you soon!"
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,20-Jun-24,5,"My wife and I traveled to the UK for our honeymoon and decided to make Restaurant Gordon Ramsay our celebratory dinner. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by their friendly and very helpful staff. The atmosphere was lovely with the color pallet consisting of white, gold and purple used was consistent and seen on everything from the walls to the furniture. We both ordered different things to taste a little bit of everything. My wife ordered the scallops for her starter while I ordered the ravioli. Both were delicious and set the expectations for the flavor profiles we were about to experience. For entrée, my wife ordered the cornish turbot and I had the Cumbrian blue gray. Her fish was so moist and flavorful. The blue gray was exquisite with the black garlic. The mushrooms alone on my plate could of been the highlight of any other meal. We did order and try the cheese before dessert but they were a bit too funky for our taste. For dessert we ordered the pecan praline and the strawberries and creme. Both were very good and not too sweet for my tastes (I don't really have a sweet tooth so it was right up my alley). The service was over the top with the staff constantly checking in and making sure everything was taken care of (they even go as far as to make sure you don't pour yourself your own water.... sorry about that haha). As we didn't have time during our wedding to finish our meals, thank you everyone who works there for making our celebratory wedding dinner one to remember forever."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,16-Jun-24,5,"Well deserving of its three Michelin stars!

Taste-9.5/10
Creativity-10/10
Presentation-10/10
Service-10/10
Ambience-10/10


Honestly it's hard to not give 10's across the board. Each dish was amazing. I supposed you could quibble with the 9.5 for taste, and make that a 10 - but on the caviar dish, the caviar flavor was swamped out by the other ingredients and was lost. If the caviar had been more highlighted then this would easily be a 10/10 meal. Realistically it was probably a 10/10 even despite this.

A few photos included... obviously the menu changes frequently.

100% go with the Carte Blanche (chef's choice) menu. You will not be disappointed. Also add the wine pairing but be forewarned, you will get fairly tipsy."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,15-Jun-24,5,"We didn't see Gordon but, this place is amazing, the food was great, the staff was professional and friendly."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,5-Mar-24,5,"Very well run business like a well oiled machine. Waiting staff listened and were in a relaxed and comfortable uniform. Cleanliness was impeccable. We went for Christmas lunch and we were not disappointed. Dishes were well balanced and a little unusual to the ""traditional"" British dishes. The flair and beauty of the dishes were worth the money, for special occasions. It was a great dining experience and we were pleased that the puddings were just right, not too filling to make you regret eating them. Good wine menu."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,29-Jan-24,5,"Tl;dr - 5 Star Service, 4 Star food (in terms of fine dining). 4.5 stars overall, rounded up because there were more highlights than lowlights.

We capped off our trip to London with a dinner at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay. We took a cab into Chelsea and walked around before walking to the restaurant, arriving approximately 15 to 20 minutes before our reservation.

We checked in at the front door to confirm our reservation before entering. We were greeted with complimentary champagne and an amuse-bouche of various tarts in the front room, while we awaited our dinner reservations.

It's a unique experience, both in the front room, and dinning room, to have the table pulled out for you. We were taken back at this level of service and it was consistent throughout our dinner.

We decided on Prestige menu and worked with the sommelier to find a wine pairing that would work with the meal.

The first course was an off-menu soup. It was light, simple and had fresh, herbaceous flavors.

The second course was the summer salad. Similar to the soup, it was light and refreshing. The elderberries popped each bite and delightful.

We were served dinner rolls in between the second and third course. The rolls were light, buttery, and a nice treat. I can't say it's the best bread that I've had, but it was good.

The third course was the world-famous Lobster Ravioli and it lived up to expectations. It was rich and had a wonderful umami flavor. I could've had several more.

The fourth course was the Cornish turbot. It was mild and smooth, with good mouth feel. However, I found the flavors to be rather mild.

The fifth course was the Cumbrian Blue Grey. It was underwhelming. The texture wasn't as tender as I would've expected and the flavor was rather mild.

We were rather full, so we skipped the cheese course.

The first dessert course was the sorbet with a crisp topper. The sorbet was refreshing, sweet and has a nice tart, while I felt guilty eating the intricate crisp.

The final dessert course was a chocolate pecan praline ice cream and to put it simply it was the single best ice cream dish that I've had period. It was creamy, rich and refreshing, with a slight smoke to it. It was addictive.

Overall, I found the food to be very good. I would gladly eat every dish again. However, I was hoping for more vibrant and explosive flavors that left lasting impressions. A few dishes reached these heights, such as the ravioli and the pecan praline ice cream, while others felt very ""safe,"" yet good, like cumbrian blue grey and Cornish turbot, with mild flavors.

The service is what elevated the experience to a 5-star review for me. While the food was very good, I would expect more from a 3 Michelin Star restaurant, give other meals that I had in London (and back in the U.S.), but the service was unparalleled.

The staff was extremely friendly and took the time to accommodate a gluten allergy that we had, walk us through the menus, wine listing and share information with us about the restaurant.

Watching the service take place was an elegant, organized chaos, with every detail accounted for throughout the dining room. If your table was dirty, they cleared it. If you dropped your silverware or napkin, they replaced it. They changed the plates and silverware in between each course so you had an untainted experience and it created an amazing atmosphere where every course was as though it was your first.

Beyond that, the server's personalized our experience, by acknowledging that we were celebrating a trip to London and our anniversary, which made it all the more special.

I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, especially those who are familiar with Gordon Ramsay's work, because it speaks to the great talent that he is, what he's built and who he's surrounded himself with.

Technicality the food is flawless. I just wish the flavors were a bit bolder.

I would definitely come back, if for nothing more than the world class service. Though, I hope for a slightly more inspired and transcendent flavor experience next time."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,2-Jan-24,5,Beef Wellington was amazing. Definitely worth the price. Service was top notch. Everything was perfect!
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,24-Dec-23,5,Beef Wellington was amazing. Definitely worth the price. Service was top notch. Everything was perfect!
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,26-Nov-23,5,"The food was excellent. We had the scallops, ravioli with lobster, pigeon, Dover sole, beef, and the chocolate and a souffle. Not a complaint. Standouts were the ravioli and Dover sole. This was our second visit in 30 years. It was a standout then."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,17-Nov-23,1,"This was our 3rd time having dinner there.
We went on 11/08/23 for our 30th anniversary celebration. We ordered CARTE BLANCHE menu which we thought will be special.
For the food, the 1st 2 appetizer came out quite good and creative, and the next few courses were a miss. the main dish, VENISON was gamey, it was ordinary and there's no WOW factor given this is a 3* michelin restaurant. My wife asked to replace it with Steak which was much better.
For the service, it was OK, we ordered a wine pairing (240 pound for 6 glasses), the 1st 2 wines paired well, the rest of 4 did not. I am not a wine snob, I just felt that the wine were served were ordinary considering being charged 40 pound per glass. and when my wife told one of the server about not liking the choice, he only said OK. We have to keep calling someone else till get it replaced with other wine.
For the grand finale, the restaurant presented us a very small cake to commemorate the special occasion, 30th anniversary. the cake was as small as the amuse bouche, what a joke !!!
Can't say we will be back again this time."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,9-Nov-23,2,"Second time visiting here, a bit disappointed, specially for the wi e paring, don't think it's worth the price, so sorry"
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,4-Oct-23,4,"*Sigh* this is an interesting one to write. My wife and I love Chef Ramsay so much & he's one of the few celebrities for us that if we saw him we'd be starstruck.

Unfortunately, I have to give the experience 3.5 stars out of 5, but I'll round it up to 4. We have been to many Michelin starred restaurants all over the world and what separates these restaurants is the service/experience, less so the food. The food here was outstanding, and ultimately saves it. The service, timing, and ambiance weren't. Don't get me wrong, the staff was extremely nice and attentive, but there were things that made the visit less than stellar.

1) Timing of the courses was quite inconsistent or delayed. I realize it can't always be perfect but when the first few courses are spaced out less than 5 minutes apart and then it takes 10-15 minutes before the main, you notice the gap. It was also a ~15 minute wait between them taking our last plates away and us receiving the check that we had to ask for. What was most disappointing was that when I'm at a restaurant of that caliber, the last thing I should be thinking is ""where is the check so I can leave?""

2) The ambiance wasn't there. There was only one room for dining and it seemed like there was maybe one too many tables in there. Sitting down at my table I was about a foot away from the guy sitting at the next table and I can tell you every word of their conversation. They faced everyone towards the center of the dining room which I liked, but it was difficult to get out from the table to visit the restroom or avoid bumping the guy to my side at the other table. A small thing to complain about but again, when you're at a place like RGR you expect these smaller details to be taken care of.

3) Service felt frantic. They take the approach of ""no one should have an empty glass"" and ""if you see an empty tray or unfolded napkin, take care of it"" - a real collaborative mentality. They take it so far that it's a detriment to the service. I don't need my water glassed re-filled every time I sip it and I'd like consistency on who is serving me so I can build a rapport over the meal. Service also wasn't very crisp. It felt a little disjointed and like the staff was pretty green or had just started working together.

After ~$750 spent for two, I expected more. I'm glad the food was bomb and we enjoyed every single bite, but they need to make some updates on service. If I'm the one dolling out stars - no chance based on last night I'm awarding more than 1."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,18-Sep-23,3,"Listen, if a restaurant wants to tell you how you should tip up, I don't mind. It's their restaurant. They have standards. It's a statement of intent. I'm up for it.
It's just that if their standards then dip below what they set, you're going to pile in.
Which is what I'm doing. It feels mean and nitpicks but they asked for it.
A Jacket is preferable when you go to Gordon Ramsey's. It's hot, but mantit sweat marks are something I'm prepared to allow for food from a place that's been three Michelin Star since I last went 20 years ago. That's some feat and I' not going to argue.
Let me be clear. The food itself was perfection. This is possibly part of my quibble though.
There aren't many edges to this place, and none of them are textured.
The service is perfectly charming.
The food is immaculate.
And the night went swimmingly.
There just wasn't much to challenge the mind or the palate.
The three menu choices were fun. A seven course tasting menu. A la carte. And a seven course tasting menu thought up on the day derived from whatever they felt was good from the produce delivered. Sounds like a laugh but I'm not wholly convinced they approve of laughter in the dining room. We went for two normal tasters and a surprise.
The room is beige. If you like beige, you'll love the room.
There's some sort of light feature in the middle of the room hanging from the ceiling that looks like an xxxl shower curtain holder. This is the most noticeable thing about the room. That and the sound of silence Art Garfunkel himself might have been deafened by as we enter.
Thankfully things did liven up as the tables filled but that first impression isn't knockout like it is when you walk into somewhere like Core.
Actually, The Fat Duck is similarly underwhelming in terms of its surroundings but they then proceed to charm you senseless with the food and the experience. A charm that's lacking here.
Amuse bouches roll out and are happily tucked away. The cheese balls I wouldn't have questioned if they had been from Papa Johns. I often wonder when eating high end food that the irony is we end up saying 'amazing, it tastes just like snickers/wotsits/Ritz crackers'. The closer you get, the better. Just like a Snickers but £45 more expensive. Winner. Anyway, the cheeseballs tasted good. Like I was watching football in front of the telly surrounded by pizza boxes and money off leaflets for my next order.
Second course in was introduced as a smoked salmon salad.
It was in fact smoked duck breast.
No worries.
Except that for the grand I'm dropping here, I thought that sort of thing was completely ironed out in the training. I literally don't care that they announced the wrong main ingredient. I can work it out for myself. That is until I remind myself that the whole reason I'm paying a small fortune for this is that nothing like this is ever supposed to happen. And they preferred I wear a jacket. I've watched The Bear. I've understood that these people have gone through nervous breakdowns to attain perfection. And I understand that means I'm going to have to shell out. I understand I need to do this in a slightly restricted jacket. So when it isn't perfect, however innocent, it rankles. That and the fact that they 'preferred' me to wear a jacket on a boiling hot night. Well if I'm paying all this money and melting at the same time, I'd prefer to know that the dish is smoked duck breast rather than smoked salmon. See, places like this turn you into a twat. I don't want to be a twat. I just want to be a normal person enjoying great food in a nice T shirt. But they wouldn't let me do that so say hello to Mr Twat.
We had a delicious concoction which was a sort of broth top layer with a cream underneath that was sheer delight. The star of the show and a hint to head chef's talent and her background coming from south east Asia.
The Somellier was wonderful and gleefully imparted his knowledge and a couple of fine suggestions.
Other than that, nothing to report other than excellently executed dish after dish enjoyed in neutral surroundings served by very proper staff although one girl loosened up enough to chat a bit about her job which was fascinating and fun. More of that please.
My son turned 18. That was the reason for our visit.
He loved every moment. It felt special to him. He'd never eaten food as good and he marvelled at all the watches in the room.
This wisened old git just wanted something with a bit more oomph. I yearned for some prefect imperfection. A Lee Scratch Perry cow moo, a Stan Bowles shirt hanging out as he ghosts past three defenders. A quirk, a bit of derring do.
For that, I'd come back donning two jackets and a corset."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,11-Sep-23,5,"The best experience I've ever had. Everything was absolutely perfect. My first three star Michelin restaurant and it def set the standards so high for the others I went to after. Everything on the menu was absolutely DELICIOUS. The service was out of this world. The ambiance wasn't really there at first but once ppl started drinking, it got louder and better. I can't wait to go back one day and have the food. Everything was so good!!!!"
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,6-Sep-23,2,"I was so excited to have beef Wellington at this restaurant. I am a big kitchen nightmares fan. It was so bland, I had to ask the waitress for some salt. It was not bad, but lacked so much flavor. Waitress gave me salt, and never asked why I thought the meat needed it. Maybe they are used to it.

Should have suspected it, when every restaurant near was full and when we sat down there were only 2 other people in the place at 8pm."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,13-Jul-23,3,"Caveat: I own a Forbes 5 star restaurant. Just this year we were at noma , geranium , aoc, jont, providence, headed to core and Helene later this week.
I would say that R. Gordon Ramsay is a hard pass if you're visiting from abroad and limited with your time. It's a nice meal but not a Michelin 3 star.
1) service was close to proper , but not a single staff member was engaging or remarkable; in this day and age stuff doesn't quite cut it anymore. The som was confused about what we ordered considering that entire table had gotten the same tasting menu. Our water glass were empty for more than 5 min on several occasions. Table was never crumbed or staines addressed
2)decor was clean and modern, restrooms up kept
3) food: price was reasonable for carte blanche tasting . Flatware were beautiful, plateing composition was inspiring . Now for taste: menu needs whole reset. The cheese puff amuse was like a mouthful of day old mac/cheese. If you're going to make bread a ""course"" then game needs to be upped, dinner rolls and shared butter doesn't quite do it. Lobster course was chewy. John Dory was a tad over cooked, mention my preference on some things., like the beans to staff and never heard back from kitchen or saw chef. The squab course from delicious, but temp was off, plates should have been fired much warmer. Entire pace of dinner was way too slow, at some point we waited 20min between courses. Total time for tasting was 4.5hrs for a 10 course meal.
I would also say I left hungry, I prefer to be present with too much food at this price point and be able to make decision to eat less.(you have be in excess at this level to cater to different guest appetites)

So overall: good for a local drop in for dinner if you have not been, beyond that, it's not a 3 star Michelin and should be stripped of some of its accolades. 1 out 10 course being good...is very bad, I don't expect to love it all, but I didn't expect to hate most of it ."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,29-Jun-23,2,"Table for 4 at lunch time during the week. 3 out of the 4 ordered the tasting menu, only had 4 glasses of wine. The bill was $1600.00. This is lunch for 4 people. Sorry this just seems exorbitantly extreme for lunch. Everything was ok, not incredible and just not worth this type of money. Understand that it is a personal choice in choosing the restaurant and menu items but sorry, that is sticker shock to some and should be noted."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,19-Jun-23,1,"This unit is horrendous. The staff is rude, the management is terrible. I would stay far far away from this location. They allow overly infectious individuals to eat on premise because if they don't they are extorted. BE WARY! There is also an active health department investigation into this unit. I would choose another location that cares about the customer a little more."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,1-Jun-23,5,Great service and elevated pub fare. The beef Wellington was tender and flavorful. My mom really enjoyed her special night
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,19-May-23,5,"I'd give this restaurant 4.5 stars if I could, but I'm rounding up because certain aspects of it--not least the service--were extraordinary. We opted for the menu prestige, and all of the little surprise appetizers and amuse bouches were outstanding. The prize goes to a revolutionary savory custard tart with the absolute freshest of spring produce and the perfect amount of caviar. This dish took my breath away. The bread and butter course was also truly sublime. Interestingly, the one course we were both disappointed with was the meat course: I had the Cumbrian blue grey and my husband had the bigger. While we understand that being spare with seasonings will help us focus on the taste of the meat, we did not find the taste of either meat noteworthy, and they tasted underseasoned to us. The cheese course, however, was a revelation. The cart and selection are jaw-dropping, and those who like washed rind stinky cheeses will NOT be disappointed here: the Epoisses was perfect, the best I've tasted; and the Muenster was the discovery of the night. The young woman who introduced the cheeses and helped us make our selection was absolutely superb--as, frankly, we're all the staff. I can easily say that this was the most polished service I've ever experienced at a restaurant. The staff have a way of making everyone feel welcome, luxuriously cared for, and at ease. Not overly fussy or pretentious at all, despite the doting care one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. And, trust me, despite the small portion sizes, you will not leave hungry, as there are A LOT of portions to taste. A once in a lifetime experience."
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,17-Mar-23,5,"Can't recommend this place enough! This experience exceeded our expectations! We had heard so much about Restaurant Gordon Ramsey for years and were worried it was all hype...but it's even better that we could have imagine On top of each delicious courses, the amazing staff and stunning decor complete the experience (there was even a bench to put my purse!).

We did the 7 course Carte Blanche with new dishes designed by the Chef and you never know what's coming next. With the complimentary canapés, amuse boucle, palate cleanser, and additional dessert (not pictured), it felt more so like 11 amazing courses!

For libations we did the wine pairing, while not an inexpensive addition was great to have all the thought taken out of drink selection and know what we were having complimented each course.

Would highly recommend for an elevated night out and/or celebration!! We can't wait to go back!"
Restaurant Gordon Ramsay,3,17-Mar-23,5,"We came here on a saturday noon. It is advisable that you book beforehand.

We got the £250 carte blanche menu cause we want to be surprised. And every plate indeed is a lovely surprise. I am still in awe of how soft the bread rolls were, it was literally a bread roll from heaven. I did make a request that if they have lamb in one of the courses, please change them to another meat because I cannot eat lamb and they happily oblige. My piece of steak was done just to my liking. We ended with pre dessert, the dessert and some small candies afterwards. I'll forever remember the taste of the chocolate- so deep and dark with almond aftertaste

Since this is a three michelin star establishment, it is of course very professional in terms of service level. You are greeted at the door and someone will take your coat away. All the servers are knowledgeable and provide for nice banter.

Restaurant ambiance is very intimate. Limited tables and table sizes are usually small."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,12-Jul-24,2,"I'll start by saying that the atmosphere is really cool and the bathroom is really creative. This place might be worth going to once.
The food was alright.
The staff was so polite and kind except for the man who served my table.
He must've been having a pretty bad day. I get it, we all have off days. He rushed me to start my afternoon tea sandwiches before it arrived on the table and before I even got the 1st course... which they forgot. My 1st pot of tea arrived and it was the wrong pot. The timing of the food and the tea was wrong. Food would show up and then tea took forever.
For the price of this afternoon tea, I expect the server to be on top of it."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,8-Jul-24,5,Wonderful service and food was delicious. We had a big celebration for our Girl Scouts the host returned with sweet macaron desserts with candies for our 3 tables. Great experience.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,8-Jul-24,5,"The food was superb. The ambiance was a modern bridgerton equipped with color, Class and champagne. The service was beyond amazing and they catered to my young child and treated her like a princess. We will be back.

Thank you sketch for a memorable experience"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,5-Jul-24,4,"My biggest advice is to not go toooo hard on the earlier courses (especially the tower with pastries and sandwiches) because we totally forgot there were still scones and cake to come! But the sandwiches, desserts, and tea are all you can eat so I think overall worth the value. My favorite was the mini lobster rolls and all the little cakes were delicious!

The decorations are a big part of the experience too! I've heard it changes seasonally but when we went in June, our room had a pink and classy vibe, with a live quartet. And it's an open secret but don't forget to check out the restrooms - the craziest designs I've e seen for a restroom."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,3-Jul-24,2,"I booked an anniversary dinner here and was quite looking forward to it. On arrival we were quickly welcomed and shown the way to our reservation area. Several hosts and hostesses wished us a happy anniversary which was very nice. Unfortunately that's where the positives ended. Staff do a good job with greeting but cups and plates lingered far too long and we had to ask for our check. Crumbs were left on our table through 2 courses. It may not seem like much but I feel these are the bare minimums for being deserving of a Michelin star. For food we went with the 3 courses from the origins menu. Two of the three dishes were a miss for me. My appetizer of white asparagus was unremarkable and forgettable. The cod as a main with spinach sauce was cooked well in terms of doneness but was quite bland and the sauce didn't taste like much. The dessert was quite nice-floating island of meringue with a beautiful scoop of ice cream underneath in addition to a basil pool. This was my favorite dish of the dinner. We were given a nice cake for anniversary celebration as well and that was much appreciated. However seeing two tables who were seated after us get their checks prior to us was a disappointment. The bathrooms are an experience, do check them out. Given my experience and expectations of this dinner I can't recommend it and would not come back."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,27-Jun-24,4,"I had an amazing dinner in the Lecture Room & Library. It's easy to see why Michelin awarded it three stars.

The decor is bright and unusual but still fancy.

My meal was incredibly good. My favorite courses on the tasting menu were the haddock, langoustine, and the veal. The wine pairings were good but next time I will probably get the standard instead of splurge.

Service was impeccable!

My only disappointment was waiting almost 20 minutes to get a taxi after the end of the meal. It's difficult to believe there was a huge demand at 10pm on a Wednesday. But, unlike most other fine dining restaurants I have been at--Hide, for example, typically orders a taxi for me and let's me know when it arrives so I spend no time waiting out on the street. Ditto The Ledbury--Sketch will not organize a taxi for guests.

Instead, guests can ask the doorman to waive over a taxi if an available one happens by. There does not seem to be many drop offs on the section of Conduit Street in the evening so it was a long wait.

Otherwise, it was a fantastic experience."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,21-Jun-24,5,"This review is for the lecture room and library, and our dinner here was hands down the best dining experience of our lives! We were absolutely blown away and amazed for every second of our evening here. The service was the most friendly, fun, knowledgeable and attentive I have ever experienced. The ambiance left us speechless. The evening here was the highlight of our two week trip in Europe, and we had some amazing experiences.
The hostess' tour after our dinner of the other rooms really left us feeling like we had the most magical and epic time.
I know I haven't mentioned the food yet, it was exceptional and it alone warranted the 5 star review, but we knew going to a 3 Michelin star restaurant would give us perfect cuisine, but the service and impeccable ambiance stunned us and left us feeling like this truly was a highlight from our holiday abroad. Thank you, Sketch for a memory my wife and I will always cherish."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,3-Jun-24,5,"If you find yourself in London and you don't go check out Sketch, you have made a huge mistake.
Truly one of the coolest places I have ever been to.
From the GORGEOUS forest themed back bar to the other worldly bathrooms, It is a fully immersive dining experience unlike any other.
Great service, incredible food and masterful cocktails!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,1-Jun-24,5,"My husband and I are on our honeymoon and chose this restaurant as a special date night and are so glad we did! Upon arrival we were treated with the upmost hospitality. The restaurant was beautiful and unlike anything we have ever experienced before. We both did the tastings menu and shared a bottle of white wine recommended by the sommelier. We were constantly checked on and explained each dish. The menu had a wide variety of foods, many of which I have never tried before. The staff also sent us links in an email for other foods to try during the rest of our honeymoon. They also gave us a tour after our meal and we got to see the famous bathrooms! I hope to be able to make it back one day. Most amazing dining experience we've ever had!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,27-May-24,3,"I had very high hopes for Sketch and in the end had a fairly mixed experience.

The venue itself is great. The reservations were difficult to secure, so book early (though I'm not totally sure why as it wasn't overwhelmingly crowded? I think maybe some of the rooms were closed at the time we went). There are 5 rooms, so be sure to at least glance at each of the various themes. We landed a spot in the parlor. This was fine-the pictures online do it a bit of a favor. Grabbed a spot on one of the couches, which overall was a very normal cocktail bar seat. Everyone had told us to check out the bathroom, which is an interesting little art installation (explanation is on the wall walking up).

The drinks themselves were very fine. The prices are likely reflective of the overall experience so we weren't so interested in getting more than one.

The service at first was great, super friendly and attentive. However, halfway through our experience they were inundated with ?a birthday party? of about 20 people at once, at which point we became essentially non-existent to them as they tried to sort this out, so getting the check was a bit of a hassle.

The vibe of the parlor beside the seating was not my favorite. The DJ's choices were a bit aggressive for the amount of people in the room who were simply having conversations. Also, there are signs posted about being respectful of taking pictures in the area and being mindful of other patrons when doing so, so I found it a bit off-putting when I found myself in the background of the DJ filming what I assume was some sort of live social media moment.

Overall, the hype is focused on the venue space and you can probably get this from the pictures themselves online."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,27-May-24,5,"From the moment you step into Sketch London, you're enveloped in a mesmerizing atmosphere. The vibrant decor and dynamic energy captivate your senses immediately. The stylish, warm, and welcoming hostess explained the multiple bars and restaurants, one of which boasts three Michelin stars (be sure to reserve in advance for that culinary experience).

We explored the three downstairs bars, each with its own unique charm. Two of them had DJs playing lively music, perfect for a Saturday evening. Despite being busy, they were incredibly accommodating for walk-ins. My friend and I indulged in some delightful small bites and exquisite drinks at the middle bar, where everything was absolutely wonderful, and the service was impeccable.

Just when I thought my night was ending, I met Simon. He convinced me to stay a little longer and experience more of what Sketch has to offer. He graciously escorted me to the East Bar, a futuristic haven that feels like stepping into a spaceship and being transported to a world of mesmerizing art and fantastic music. Luc (Luke), the charming bartender, crafted phenomenal drinks and engaged in delightful, meaningful conversations with his guests. The couple next to me couldn't stop raving about their cocktails and service.

Every staff member I encountered that night exuded pride in their roles and went above and beyond to ensure I had a memorable experience. I had an outstanding evening, with every aspect surpassing my expectations. My gratitude goes out to the team at Sketch for their warm hospitality and for making the night truly unforgettable. I am eagerly looking forward to my next visit!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,26-May-24,5,Great decor and the drinks were amazing! They even did a surprise birthday dessert. Espresso martini was amazing.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,18-May-24,3,"The fancy Sketch restaurant was even more beautiful in person. The bathrooms are their most popular spot, so definitely don't miss that. It looks even better than some art museums. We had to come here after seeing so many instagram posts over the years!

This was the first afternoon tea that I've ever heard of being all you can eat, and you can get boxes at the end to bring stuff home. So that got me really excited... however, your second order will take FOREVER to come out. Sometimes they won't even remember that you wanted more of a certain item. And even after constantly reminding them, they still don't bring it out. So was it worth £80? Probably not.

Also don't get bamboozled by the £1 at the end, they automatically add it to your bill but you can ask the server to remove it."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,2-May-24,5,"What a treat for a fancy afternoon tea. The sandwiches were amazing, and the sparkling rose was perfection. The decor is so fun, and the staff is so kind."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,2-May-24,5,"I have seen posts about this place for over a year, so I was SO excited to finally be able to experience it!! Made reservations for High Tea. Such cool, interesting decor! Tea service was about 4 courses, so we ended up taking A LOT of food home!! Some of it was ""interesting"" (caviar lolipops??) but definitely a great time!! I had to visit the famous bathroom and they did not disappoint!! Hard to explain but very futuristic and modern!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,21-Apr-24,5,"Imagine stepping into a technicolor dream in the heart of Mayfair. That's exactly what Sketch feels like! I visited in January 2024, and it was an experience that's still glowing bright in my memory.

Forget beige tablecloths and predictable decor. Sketch is a kaleidoscope of vibrant spaces, each one more outrageous than the last. One room feels like you've stepped into a Wes Anderson dream, all sunshine yellow and plush velvet. Another is a gallery come to life, with fantastical art that practically leaps off the walls (with the help of a cool AR app!).

But the beauty goes beyond the aesthetics. The service at Sketch is like a perfectly choreographed ballet. The staff are attentive without being intrusive, their knowledge of the menu and wine list is impressive, and they play their part in the overall theatrical experience.

Speaking of the menu, well, that's another adventure entirely. Chef Frédéric Don's creations are playful and artistic, with flavor combinations that will surprise and delight. It's more than just a meal; it's a journey for the tastebuds.

Now, be warned, Sketch isn't for the faint of wallet. It's a splurge, for sure. But if you're looking for a truly unique and unforgettable dining experience, then this is your place. In January, the festive spirit must have added another layer of magic to the whole sunshine-filled atmosphere.

So, if you're looking to escape the ordinary and treat yourself to a night of culinary and visual delights, then Sketch is a must-visit. Just be prepared to have your world turned upside down (in the best way possible)!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,5-Apr-24,1,"This was definitely not the place for a true Afternoon Tea experience. The food is sub par and the most unthinkable thing happened. . . They ran out of 3 teas that we requested. How does a restaurant serving tea time with only 10 tea choices run out of tea? Even the ambiance is pretty cheesy, except for the restroom. So I guess just walk in and request to use the bathroom and save yourself $100 per person."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,5-Apr-24,5,Honestly such a vibe ! This place not only has amazing tea but also is so beautiful. I really love how the staff was completely attentive the whole time and kindly catered to my needs. I will be coming back here consistently! Now my favorite place in London !
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,20-Mar-24,5,The ambiance is amazing. It's definitely an experience. The tea is delicious and the treats are abundant.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,17-Mar-24,5,Best afternoon tea. Great service. Amazing place. Has a real cool vibe. Beautiful interior. A must try.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,10-Mar-24,5,"When you enter through the dim hallway going deep inside this building, you feel like Alice passing through the looking glass and following the rabbit down the hole. The two separate dining rooms have different motifs, one with an under the sea Little Mermaid vibe and the other, a brightly painted whimsical Wonderland. You would think this place popped out of Lewis Carroll's head. The atmosphere is surreal and you feel like you're joining the Mad Hatter, the March Hare and the Dormouse for high tea. And there is a three piece string ensemble in the corner playing popular tunes on violin, viola & cello. The ladies did very good instrumental renditions of Coldplay's Viva La Vida and Justin Bieber's Sorry.

We are here for high tea with friends and the tea selection is excellent. Since we could order as much and as many different teas as we wanted, I started with the black teas, first a pot of Earl Grey and then Darjeeling. All tea pots are individual and serves about 2 cups. Then I moved onto the Phoenix Honey Orchid, which was very mild and my favorite. Of course, I had to have it with honey, which came in a little carafe. My last pot was the Organic Dragon Well green tea.

The tea sandwich and cake tiered tray is the main event. Each of the sandwiches, the Coronation Chicken, Cucumber, Salmon & Ricotta and Croque Monsieur are cut into finger length rectangles. The chicken and ham & cheese of the Croque Monsieur were excellent, but I was surprised I really liked the cucumber as well. Request as many more sandwiches as you like and they will bring more. But don't forget the sweet side of the tiers with multiple cakes.

Then things got a little strange. Having consumed so much tea, I was first to seek the rest rooms, which were in an adjacent room. I thought I was transported to Woody Allen's movie Sleeper. Up the stairs into the stark white high ceiling room was a bunch of 6' tall white egg pods which reminded me of Robin Williams, Mork's spaceship from Ork. I had to ask the attendant in a maid's uniform to find me an available ""egg"". Someone please pinch me. At the bottom of the room was a round lounge area with 70's motif that the musician's took their breaks between sets.

The service was impeccable with exceptional attention to detail, as expected from a high end restaurant. Overall, this was an amazing experience that I would recommend to anybody visiting London. Don't forget to point your pinkie finger as you raise your teacup to your lips."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,16-Feb-24,5,"We loved sketch! First of all the ambiance is so beautiful and there's so much cool art in there. The bathrooms were also so futuristic haha it was really fun to just see. The service is incredibly! My friend and I did the high tea and we also got some great cocktails with it. I didn't necessarily lovee their food (it's high tea ya know tea sandwiches, biscuits were ok), but I think you more so go for the experience and tea. Tea was fantastic as we got unlimited tea for our 2 hour experience. I'm so glad we decided to do this and it's certainly a fun experience if you never experienced high tea!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,4-Feb-24,5,The cocktails are incredible!!! We also love the vibe here. The music and decor is unique!
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,4-Feb-24,5,"I must start this review by giving a special shoutout to Mr. Angus Agnew, the guest relations director at Sketch, who made our trip to Sketch such a memorable one.

If you don't know, Sketch is a gorgeous multi-space restaurant with a variety of dining experiences. From a three Michelin star restaurant to a bar located inside the bathroom, do your research and determine which of the many Sketch experiences you'd like to partake in. When visiting London, it's an absolute must to come here- even if just so that you can get that infamous bathroom mirror selfie.

We decided to do the afternoon tea experience. We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation, but our table was not ready. We immediately began chatting with Angus and loved his lovely, welcoming demeanor. After realizing our table was taking longer than expected, he made our wait worthwhile and took us on a mini tour of the space! We got to explore all the different exquisite restaurants and were blown away by the level of detail in the design of every corner of this space. It felt like our own little private tour and for two American tourists, it made for quite a memorable evening!

Once seated, we got to enjoy our afternoon tea. Because we came during New Years, we enjoyed the Christmas tea which included a variety of winter themed treats! You'd think that tea wouldn't be so filling, but by the last course, we were stuffed.

During the tea, we enjoyed the sounds of live musicians playing Beatles classics and a ballerina on pointe dancing throughout the room! What an experience.

Sketch is a must, period."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,21-Jan-24,2,"Ok, this place gets a solid 5 stars for ambience, decor, and friendliness. But if you are coming to eat, not just take Instagram photos, don't expect to walk away feeling completely satisfied.

The minute you walk in, the decor is on point. It really is dreamlike. They have such lovely staff working. Multiple greeting points, coat check, and super organized. I had high hopes at this point. We were greeted by our serves, both extremely friendly, but not overly fussy towards us.

The food, lackluster. There are two sides to the menu. Traditional and ""open minded"" we chose two from each side. The filet was pretty bland, and in my opinion, ridiculously chewy. Scallops (from the open mind section) were delicious, but only came with 3. The soufflé of scallop and fish was off putting. It basically tasted of only eggs with a mild scallop flavor, drenched in heavy cream. Surprisingly, the most flavorful dish was the gnocchi and the side of fries.

Again, lovely place. But the emphasis is on the aesthetic not so much the food."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,6-Jan-24,3,"Solid 3.5 experience!

Ambiance (5/5): Wow, this restaurant is absolutely magical. I don't think I have ever dined at an establishment with a unique avant garde vibe. Their bathroom is a must see, you will be blown away! They also have different rooms throughout the restaurant, each with their own theme.

Service (5/5): Our server, Marco, was extremely attentive and honest. When we asked for his suggestions he didn't push the more expensive dishes on us, which we appreciated. He checked up on us frequently and made sure we had everything we needed. On top of that, the food came out in a timely manner.

Food (3/5): Their food and cocktails were average at best. Nothing really stood out. We ordered the scallop carpaccio, roasted venison, and artichoke heart. The scallop carpaccio was extremely gritty and almost tasted like we were eating sand. Additionally, it had zero flavor. Our server was kind enough to remove it off the bill and recommended that we try the grilled scallop instead. This dish was served with a pumpkin puree and we thought it sounded enticing so we agreed. Unfortunately, the dish was extremely underwhelming-- it's almost like they tried too hard to be creative with the pumpkin puree. Quite honestly, it did not pair well with the scallop and for $56 USD it most certainly was a waste of $$$. The venison was not bad, it came with a cabbage salad that we enjoyed and the artichoke wasn't terrible either but again for the price point we were expecting more. The food at Sketch was severely overpriced and underwhelming at best.

Overall, we have been to far better restaurants across the globe and the food at Sketch was not as creative as we had hoped it would be. For their price point, come and grab drinks by their bar so you can enjoy their unique ambiance-- if you are into that!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,4-Jan-24,5,"Sketch you were lovely and worth all the hype I saw online.
Came to London and everyone recommended getting a resy at sketch! Online it was fully booked, but we walked in and asked (during the busiest time of year) and they had availability. They keep spots open for walk ins, we were able to come in for high tea the next day! It was lovely, food was delish and drinks were beautiful.
Highly recommend."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,3-Jan-24,5,"The afternoon tea experience was incredible! We came in at the beginning of December after booking online. One of the reasons I chose Sketch was because they have special menus for those who have vegan and vegetarian dietary requirements. I emailed ahead of time to make sure I noted that on my booking, and a staff member responded quickly and assured me everything was taken care of.

When we checked in with the hostess, she brought us to a cute booth in the yellow dining room. I'm a little sad they changed the decor from the lovely pink I've seen in photos, but the new renovation is still beautiful. The waiter was with us shortly with a big smile on his face. He explained the courses we would get included with afternoon tea, and let us know we could order as much tea, coffee, and water as we liked. We were also able to order seconds of any of the pastries or sandwiches.

For my first pot of tea, I ordered the Phoenix Honey Orchid Oolong, which was earthy and nice. But after trying a sip of my cousins Vanilla Black tea, I just had to order some for myself! I loved it so much, I need to buy it. The vanilla came through strongly and gave such a creamy flavor.

As for the food, we were amazed from the first bite. We were given 2 appetizers, then brought a 3 tiered stand of our sandwiches and desserts. My favorites were the cucumber sandwich with a quail egg on top and the coronation chickpea salad sandwich, which I did get seconds of. Then we were brought scones (our choice of plain or with dried fruit) with cream and jam. Then we were offered more cake from their dessert table, and finished off with the lovely little macarons. We finished everything, but they did offer to box anything up.

Now we have to talk about the bathrooms, which is the other reason I chose to dine here. Not only are they clean inside and out (I have tons of video to prove it), but they are art. The entire restaurant is art from the moment you walk inside- the ballerina that danced through the tea parlor, the string duo, the decor, and the cute drawings within the menu. It was above and beyond what we could've imagined!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,31-Dec-23,1,"Quite possibly the worst food I have ever eaten, with rude service and slow inattentive service. The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful tho and the hostess are lovely. Overall would not go again for food but more for a pleasant picture of the restaurant itself."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,29-Dec-23,3,"I'm absolutely sad not being the 1000th review as I had meant to write when Sketch only had 999. Oh well, 1001 will do. (Update, I left this draft for half a year so I think they're at 1036 now).

I was torn between 3 and 4 stars tbh. Heard this place got a few Michelin stars so we checked it out on our group's trip to Londontown. The first thing you notice is that there are multiple rooms with diff vibes and nice decor. We sat in what I think is the main room next to the bathroom (more on that later).

The menu is separated by traditional fare and more modern takes on food. Our group ordered appetizers and main courses from both.

Appetizers:
Would recommend the lobster bisque with 3 layers of rice. Would also recommend the escargot with foie gras dish. Would not recommend the oysters with ginger, not because it's not good, but because they jack up the price for something (literally) any restaurant could make.

Main course
We had a few fish/seafood dishes, pork, and steak options. I tried all my friend's dishes and they were all okay. Halfway through my dish, I noticed my fish was raw. I'm a sashimi fan, but wasn't expecting this...this didn't seem right so I said something to them. They quickly addressed this and made me another dish of my choosing.

I left this review as a draft for about half a year. My final decision is to bring it down to 3 stars. For a Michelin restaurant, I think the food was underwhelming. I do give props for the friendly staff and the vibes. They have a restroom that is well known for people to take pics in."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,28-Dec-23,3,"After The Gallery at sketch renovated to that hideous yellow, I debated whether I even had to go. I decided the bathroom alone is worth the visit and last minute booked whatever was available in the building The Glade has a veggie-based (with seafood options!) menu than can be enjoyed in a vibey Alice in Wonderland-esque interior.

It's a prix-fix so you choose 2-3 courses from the menu. Overall, it tasted fine ‍ There's not much to say bc nothing stood out. Some dishes were def interesting for sure. I did enjoy the spelt risotto and its firm grainy texture was cool but that's about it. Can't rly recommend it but I do think it's a solid choice if your priority is the bathroom. Mine was for sure, and I was content by what was offered!

for Two Dishes £37
for Three Dishes £42

핑크핑꾸한 갤러리가 촌스러운 노란색으로 리모델링되어서 갈까말까 망설였지만 화장실은 꼭 가보고 싶어서 여기로 예약함. Glade는 육식 없이 생선&채소로만 이뤄진 메뉴고 2/3 코스를 선택해서 먹어야한다 (단품 ‍). 맛이 없다기보다 그냥 애매하고 택스쳐가 매우 난잡함. 그래도 인테리어 하나는 이쁘다!! 이상한 나라 앨리스 느낌의 벽지랑 데코가 눈은 즐겁게 해준다. 음식 퀄리티는 기대하지말고 화장실로 사진찍으러 가기"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,21-Dec-23,5,"This evening has been in planning for a long time, as I wanted to treat my teenage daughter to an afternoon tea while in London over Christmas. Well, we were not disappointed. From the whimsical interior to the [well-designed] menu with a good selection of teas (Vanilla Black being this party's absolute favorite), sandwiches (with a particularly delicious Croque Monsieur and Cucumber/Egg ones) and pastries (especially the Redcurrant and Lychee Eclair) to the overall atmosphere - it was a lovely evening. The service seemed a bit overwhelmed at times, but it did not deduct much from the evening. Definitely recommend it for those looking for a tea spot in London.

Oh, do visit their restrooms - they are quite out of this world"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,21-Dec-23,5,"Sketch is DELIGHTFUL at Christmastime -- there was a trio of violinists, and they hired a ballerina to dance in the aisle! Our server, Marco, was just as delightful: his hospitality, kindness, and professionalism were remarkable. They went out of their way to accommodate any dietary restrictions we had, and when they found out it was the second time my friend and I had been there, Marco brought us a little tart with a candle in it welcoming us back! The food was delicious and beautiful, and we took some great pictures. I will be back for a third time!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,16-Dec-23,2,"Sketch certainly provides a fun, artistic ambiance for an afternoon tea. We enjoyed the violinists, and I can understand the hype behind the photographic decor. However, the food and prices at this teahouse are not the best. Quite frankly, you will pay a LOT for some pretty gross food yet cute tea experience. For example, it was $230 total (tip included) for 2 of us to eat here - wild! Even though we spent more than we had anticipated for our afternoon tea experience, we are glad that we went here and shared some laughs as we tried to fit in and eat the food."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,15-Dec-23,3,"I was in London visiting my then fiance when I had stumbled upon Sketch. The Instagram page looked so aesthetic and vibey, I was excited to have brunch. I made a reservation easily online and we hopped on the tube to head into the city. Finding Sketch was a bit of a challenge, it blends in with the other buildings- I think this adds to the allure. Upon entering, it was dark with neon lighting. Each room had a different vibe- art pieces everywhere. It was a very cool vibe. We were sat in the Tea Room at a corner booth that was very cute. I wish we would have booked the pink room, though!

We ordered our breakfast and I don't think there was any delay in the service, our food came out promptly! I ordered the Avocado Toast and maybe because I am American, I was disappointed. The Avocado was a puree and the poached egg was very runny and burst open onto my clothes. I should have gone with my gut instinct which would have been a pancake but my fiance teased me!

The coolest room was the loo. There were colored tiles and pods! It was giving Alien vibes for sure. I may go back just for drinks!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,15-Dec-23,5,"From the moment we walked in we were impressed. From the beauty of the decor to the incredible service from the reception desk to our server and the other team members we encountered. We were also able to meet the Director Of Guest Experience, Angus. His passion for Sketch and his guests is felt by everyone who enters.

We had lunch in the Parlour and hand a wonderful time. As we were talking at the table and enjoying our cocktails the music changed and a surprise performance happened.

Our server Sophia was fantastic. She was friendly and attentive. She took incredible care of us and she gave us wonderful recommendations and really made our experience memorable.

We started our meal with a Glow Shot and then moved onto a Burrata Salad while enjoying our cocktails. My friend ordered the Your Love which he really enjoyed. They also have my favorite tequila so I was excited about that and enjoyed it. We moved on to order the steak and salmon for our entrees and the steak was cooked to perfection. My friend really enjoyed his salmon.

We are still talking about lunch and I'll be visiting again soon to celebrate a friend's birthday!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,8-Dec-23,3,"Erm... I'll give them this: Sketch is beautifully decked out and makes for good photos. However, the ambience isn't quite as magical in person, and food is just absolutely not it. Granted, we came for a light lunch so didn't try a ton, but both the chicken and the club sandwich were mediocre at best. Chicken was bland, sandwich was almost stale.

It's cool getting to explore different rooms in the restaurant, and of course the bathrooms are iconic. Again, the place makes for better photos than actual experience. If you're there in person, decor is still cool but you can tell a lot of the stuff it's past its prime--bit older now. Overall a place worth checking out once, but wouldn't go back."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,2-Dec-23,5,"Sketch is all about the spectacle, and in a way, it has to be; a 3-star Michelin meal is travel worthy, attracting diners from across the globe to experience what is promised to be exceptional dining, unforgettable multi-course dinners, and unmatched service that treats you like royalty. The concept of the 5-branch restaurant aims to capture the magic of a great meal, appealing to elements of the fantastical.

And that is why my experience at Sketch, Lecture Room and Library was wonderful, yet extremely bizarre (in a good way). My family had a reservation for The Lecture Room at its opening hour, so we were the first customers to dine for the night. The six of us were led up a grand velvet staircase by a woman in French maid attire to double doors: the entrance to the most secluded part of the restaurant. Like a well-rehearsed play, the curtains opened and two identical groups of waiters in uniform, lined up at each end of the doors, turned to us, smiled, and in near perfect unison greeted us with a ""welcome in."" It was eerie, being the only customers in the restaurant for a good half-hour. We felt watched; seated at a long rectangular table, we were outnumbered by waiters, and if we were having a private conversation about let's say, wine for example, not ten seconds later three waiters would present us with an extensive list of sparkling, reds, whites, and rose. It was so quiet you could hear every inhale and exhale; a pin drop would equate to the sound of shattered glass.

Everything about the service at Sketch was theatrical, which is exactly what you pay for. I had ordered the dessert cheese plate which I thought would be similar to the size of a typical charcuterie board and next thing I know, eight massive desks of aged cheese are wheeled into the restaurant, which you can only imagine how that made the restaurant smell. The whole ordeal made everyone burst into laughter and will be the reason why Sketch gets a 5-star review for impeccable service and entertainment."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,1-Dec-23,2,"I wish I could rate the service separate because the staff was impeccable... but the food was THAT bad. As someone said earlier, I can see why influencers or a pretentious crowd would love this place as the decor is over the top and the service is on the borderline of smothering.

However, I am for the food first. We had the 7-course tasting dinner menu. There were a couple dishes like the duck that were pretty good but overall there was nothing that made me say ""Wow I need to come back for this.."" Some dishes just did not have flavor.

By the 4th course I was ready to call it a night because the flavors just did not marry together. I wish I could have just cut it short because the dessert course was the worst. I actually almost could not swallow it... one dish tastes like old perfume. The others once again the flavors were just not complementary. The ""tiramisu"" was the best of the dessert and it barely had any flavor or sweetness to it... but it was palatable.

I don't understand how this place got the 3-star rating frankly.. even the presentation of the food was not always uniform.

Bottom line: If you want to pay $600 for some cute instagram pics...give it a go! But don't come for the food."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,29-Nov-23,5,"Insane restaurant. Just really pushes the envelope for an experience while dining. The rooms are wildly different and provides something for everyone.

The food is wonderful and don't miss the dramatic drinks.

The staff are very helpful and here to guide you through the experience"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,13-Nov-23,3,"We just left this restaurant and I'm sorry to say that it was an interesting yet disappointing experience. I'm not a pretentious person, but this did feel like a pretentious place. Instagrammable, influencer types love it here, and of course, I can see why.
Ambiance: A+ very cool rooms and those toilets are very fun and interesting.
Food: Meh. I am left unimpressed. As a matter of fact, I was sick this morning coming off of dinner last night. The Sea bass had no flavor, I did have to use salt and pepper to give it something. The Chantilly lace was just ok. For a $200 dinner for 2, it wasn't really worth the food. The ambiance and drinks, I'd go back. But not for the food.
Service was great though. No complaints there."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,11-Nov-23,2,"It's all a facade. They trick you with elaborate lighting and atmosphere to cover up the mediocre and under seasoned food. I was in the glade room which was the lunch room. The only food that I enjoyed was the small bite sized appetizers. The bathroom feels like an episode of the black mirror, it has egg shaped pods with doors that do not lock correctly. They have to maids dressed in the stereotypical black and white lace outfits. I do not recommend coming here if you value your money. It is overpriced for the quality of the food."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,10-Nov-23,4,Okay I'd honestly only go here for drinks and to take pictures! I had the oysters to start and they were overly fishy and I'm picky about my oysters and could tell they weren't fresh. The sea bass was okay nothing special. Now for dessert macaroons were very tasty but the chocolate cake tasted like cigarettes.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,24-Oct-23,1,"We were very excited to go there but our experience was quickly ruined. We were seated 30 minutes after our reservation time and they started taking our orders us after another 30 minutes after seated. Tea arrived after another 30 minutes (so we have been in this place 1h and 30 minutes and we didn't even receive a glass of water). After our tea, we asked for another round of tea, another 30 mins. I asked for an espresso, the waitress came back after 20 minutes telling that she forgot I wanted an espresso and now is too late because they were closing :-). I asked if she could just give me a cup of coffee take away, she said they don't have to go cups. Snacks are ok, tbh a but stale. The place is not bad (in terms of decor), but very loud and hard to have a conversation in there if you don't drink any champagne that is overpriced and not that great. 3 people $500 for 2 rounds of tea, 1 bottle of champagne and assorted snacks. Never again, worst place ever."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,23-Oct-23,5,"Love love love this place! The vibe is everything! Well crafted cocktails, great DJ and great service. I suggest making reservations but not necessary."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,23-Oct-23,5,"Wow- this by far was the most beautiful restaurant I've ever been to. There are several different dining rooms/experiences. All decorated differently- but equally beautiful. The entrance is enchanting.
We had breakfast, and the food was delicious and beautiful!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,10-Oct-23,5,"We went for afternoon tea and it was a fantastic experience. It's definitely a more unique type of afternoon tea vs. the more traditional tea you can find at other spots in London, but we adored our experience here.

Sketch is divided into several rooms for different meals and the afternoon tea is held in a beautiful parlor with pink velvet seats everywhere. There was a string quartet that played while we had our tea and they were very good!

I felt that they gave us a ton of food and sweets for tea, including as much tea as we wanted. The desserts were my favorite but also loved the croque madame and coronation chicken sandwiches, so we got seconds.

Service was helpful. This place is so photogenic so realllt just enjoyed the ambiance and finally making it to the place I've seen on Instagram everywhere :)"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,29-Sep-23,4,"Review of high tea. I enjoyed the experience, but I don't think this can be the best high tea place in London.

This is definitely one of the top places to go for tea in London, because separately another friend who was visiting London a couple weeks after me chose this place for tea. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the experience, however, as someone who doesn't love sweets, I think I would enjoy another tea place at this price point. Basic tea is 80 pounds and then you can add extra things.

We started with a Cherry & Lychee Martini and Beesou Spritz. Both were delicious, but I was jealous of my sister's martini. I didn't get it, because I don't like gin, but the gin was very subtle. I'd highly recommend it.

I really enjoyed everything savory, like the sandwiches and the scones. I wasn't entirely impressed with all the sweets and left them half uneaten on my plate. They were a little too sweet for me. It is a lot of food though and we saw a lot of people taking the final cake to go.

The string trio was a really nice touch and I like how the tea pots only carry like 2-3 cups of tea in each so you can try a couple flavors.

The most surprising part of this place is the bathrooms. My sister hyped it up, but didn't share exactly why they're iconic. I kept watching groups of people walk to the bathroom the whole time wondering what was in there. I just have to say, it lived up to expectations. I also find it hilarious that people take sultry pictures in there. Those bathrooms might be the main draw to eat here.

We got here 30 minutes early and they were nice enough to seat us. I wouldn't be mad if someone suggested coming here, but with all the high tea places in London I believe I'd like another one better."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,19-Sep-23,4,"This is definitely an iconic spot to visit! I came for the colorful, space like bathroom pods. A great photo opportunity for sure. If you just want to order at the bar, no reservation is required.

The food was okay, but expensive for what it is. I ordered the chicken dish and it wasn't bad, but nothing spectacular or filling. The chicken came with a gravy and was slightly dry. I did not have a drink, but I heard drinks are good here."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,11-Sep-23,5,"Appetizers were good we got the Duck Foie Gras and Chantilly Lace. Both were insane. Def recommend. For mains we got the Fillet, Chicken Breast, and Veal. All pretty good but not the best I've ever had. Which is what I'm expecting at a three Michelin star restaurant. Aura was cool and there was a dj and bar in the bathroom lol. Would come back but get different main courses"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,9-Sep-23,5,Wonderfully artsy ambience. Our group went for drinks only so I cannot review the food. Staff was attentive. Presentation and quality of drinks was impressive.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,4-Sep-23,5,"I can't say something more because the food are amazing!.
The first time, I and my family came here, everything so great. Good service, nice décor"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,28-Aug-23,5,"Marco (Croatian) went above and beyond to make our afternoon tea a wonderful experience! Not only was he an attentive server- he even pre-ordered extra croque sandwiches because I told him how excited I was to see them on the menu. I wanted to tip extra (American here for the weekend) but wasn't able to and didn't have lbs on me, what a bummer. I wish all the service charge went directly into his pocket ++. What a gem, Sketch is lucky to have him! Louis who came by a few times to check on us was also wonderful!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,26-Aug-23,5,"Wow, wow, wow! While we have been to Sketch before, this was our first time upstairs in the Lecture Room & Library. It is an amazing sensory experience on all levels. The food is incredible, among the best Michelin 3-star food we have ever had. The service is warm and genuine. The wine pairing with lunch was outstanding. Truly a wonderful afternoon."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,17-Aug-23,5,"Afternoon tea at the Parlour - must be the most artistic, stunningly creative restaurant. Everything from the museum-like exhibitions (computer algorithm aided, very modern website too!) to the neo-classical decor to egg-shaped bathrooms. They've really embodied the idea of ""rethinking from the ground up"" - every dish surprised me in some way. (Even the ketchup for fish and chips was house-made and with a twist of paprika!) The scones were incredible, especially the fig jam, and paired with vanilla black tea"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,10-Aug-23,1,"My partner and I had the worst food poisoning of our lives from this place. Should have known from the name ""sketch"" that the food would be sketchy. If you want some overpriced mid-grade food with excessive mayonnaise that could potentially leave you violently throwing up for hours on end, this is the place !

I'm sure the restaurant will deny the food poisoning is from them, but this is literally all me and my partner ate that day."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,5-Aug-23,5,"Sketch is a Michelin-starred restaurant in Mayfair, London, that offers a variety of dining experiences. The Lecture Room & Library is the crown jewel of Sketch, renowned for its New French cuisine. The other sections of Sketch offer varied dining experiences, including breakfast and lunch at the Parlour, cocktails, and tapas at the Glade, afternoon tea and dinner at the Gallery, and small plates at the Eastbar & Pods.

This place is less 'dining room' and more 'castle banquet hall' meets 'Sherlock Holmes's study.' I'm talking sky-high ceilings decked with chandeliers, a seating plan that's more 'velvet throne' than 'Ikea dining chair,' and more books on the walls than in your average university library. Maybe it's their secret recipe collection, who knows?

The waitstaff here has clearly been to hospitality Hogwarts - they're so attentive, they'd probably notice if you dropped a crumb. And the menu? They know it like it's the back of their Harry Potter books.

This is your spot if you're after a dining experience that's less 'Tuesday night takeaway' and more 'Academy Awards of Eating.' But beware, they're not exactly giving it away - you'll need to dig deep into your pockets.

Pros:
* Interiors are lavish enough for a royal wedding.
* Cuisine is so creative it could host its own TED talk.
* Presentation is so stunning it should be on the catwalk.
* Flavors that will perform a Broadway show on your tongue.

Cons:
* Prices are so steep you'll need mountain climbing gear.
* Scoring a reservation is like finding a unicorn. Good luck with that!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,29-Jul-23,3,"Ambience is amazing. You should come here just for the bathrooms. There are three restaurants here, and I went to the part that is cheapest, and Allows walkins and doesn't require reservations. Food is awful though so don't bother even trying anything expensive. Finger sandwiches were inedible. Although the scallop soup was pretty good. The pastries were not very good. Also, cannot recommend the yogurt coffee drink. Service is so so."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,29-Jul-23,5,"One of the best dining experiences we have ever had. The service was phenomenal, and so kind with recommendations and service. Came for afternoon tea, which had live music and an amazing spread of sandwiches and desserts.

Some of our favorites were the eggs drumkilbo, croque monsieur, apricot eclair and citrus tart. The jasmine silver needle was also an unbelievable cup of tea. Would recommend this to anyone who lives or is visiting London."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,26-Jul-23,5,Go for the bathrooms stay for food! Very eclectic menu but fun and worth trying! The art and decor are amazing fun!
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,24-Jul-23,4,"The ambiance is amazing! I came for their afternoon tea in the gallery. They have live music, great decor, and the egg bathroom. The teas are unlimited so I was able to try 3 different types of tea which is great! However, the actual food was ok with amazing scones. I would definitely come once just to see the inside, but probably won't revisit considering the price (80pp but I heard it used to be better)"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,21-Jul-23,5,A must do when visiting London - we had a fantastic experience at the Afternoon tea. The ambiance is stunning and so unique. Our servers were very friendly and we never felt rushed. The food was beautifully presented - not everything was a hit but overall we enjoyed it and felt very full. Loved the teas and the string quartet was fantastic. Can't wait to try one of their other concepts.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,17-Jul-23,5,"Sketch is a fine dining experience you can't miss!
I came for the Afternoon Tea after seeing so many cool photos and videos and wow this place didn't disappoint!

Let me preface, since this restaurant is very popular book your reservation about a month in advance and you'll be stress free. Moving on to the Afternoon Tea experience, from the minute you walk in the place is beautiful! Staff was very friendly and quickly got us seated. The orchestra was playing as we walked in and makes you feel like you're in Bridgerton :D!

The only negative was that service felt slow at times but they were friendly nonetheless. The menu is preset and goes into detail on what to expect along with providing explanations for various tea options.
Loved everything that we had!

You can't miss the restrooms!! They're so pretty and feels futuristic - had to grab a few photos before I left.

Such a fun & memorable experience! Can't wait to come back and try other rooms!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,16-Jul-23,1,There was a mouse in the restaurant when we went Sunday lunch. Poor cleanliness and hygiene
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,12-Jul-23,3,"My daughter and I came to dine for lunch at Sketch on Thursday July 29th of this year.
I chose this establishment for it's decor and the reviews on the food.
Although these two things did live up to their reputation I will say that the service was incredibly poor.
Our waiter was prompt to begin with giving us our menu's but then took quite a while to take our cocktail orders.
When we ordered our 3 course meal we also ordered a caraffe of wine requested to be served with our mains. We received our mains and proceeded to eat most of our food until we had to request for the wine from another server as ours had disappeared. Even then it took another 10 minutes before we got the wine.
While we were already seated another couple came in and was seated to the table next to us.
While we waited for dessert a different server gave them dessert which they looked a bit surprised at. The server came over to their table and obviously said there was a mistake but to enjoy the dessert with the restaurants compliments. We waited for half an hour for our dessert until again, a different server brought our saying it was mistakenly given to another table but offered no apology or even a complimentary glass of wine or coffee.
This was my first time in London to visit my daughter who was there from France where she lives and was supposed to be a very special lunch which I was treating her to.
For the $300 Canadian I paid for lunch I was extremely disappointed and a bit embarrassed in front of my daughter for the lack of respect your establishment showed us. There was absolutely no reason we should have been treated so poorly given the circumstances. It was not busy, I had made reservations weeks prior to our visit so I was expecting and hoping for a pleasant experience. I was beyond disappointed.
I understand that some servers and kitchen staff have bad days but this mistake should have been acknowledged with at LEAST an apology or something to make up for such shoddy service.
I do not live in London nor does my daughter and I can guarantee that I would never come back nor recommend it to anyone."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,12-Jul-23,5,"Sketch is definitely a must do when you're in London but I feel like it is hyped up more for the ambiance than the food. Not that the food was bad but I had high expectations from the start. Make sure to book a reservation in advance! As it's a popular spot seats fill up fast.

The inside is beautiful. With different rooms decorated in different ways it is very instagrammable. The bathrooms are especially cool. The restaurant was completely full the whole time we were there.

The service was top notch. The waiters were amazing. Always checking up on us and making sure we were taken care of. I had the beef fillet to eat which was delicious. Also had the Burgundian egg meurette and it was good as well. Our drinks were strong and delicious. I would give it 4 stars because I felt it was a little over priced but soon learned that in London everything is expensive.

So go for a cool experience, good photos, strong drinks and a unique meal."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,10-Jul-23,2,Unfortunately not a great experience here. Some of the food was okay but was expecting a lot more from this place. Also went here for my birthday with a group of friends and a server spilled boiling water on my back. seriously???
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,4-Jul-23,2,"Great food but the worst customer service ever. We sat at our table for 20 min before someone asked for our drink order. Only 3 of the 4 drinks made it to the table and we only got the 4th drink after we asked after seeing it sitting on the bar for 10 min. We waited another 20 minutes for a waitstaff person to come over and ask us for our orders. She was very brief and unfriendly and made us feel as though we were inconveniencing her by asking questions about the menu. Then when we placed our orders which consisted of 4 entrees, 3 sides and a salad we were told our order was not above the minimum order per. Would not recommend. Definitely a little sketch."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,4-Jul-23,5,We just recently went to this place to celebrate our anniversary. Staff are really personable. Service is great. Food is good and desert was amazing. They also brought a small surprise desert for us. The bathrooms are uniquely designed and there is a small and cozy Dj area under the bathroom area which adds to the already amazing vibe of this place.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,3-Jul-23,4,The decor and ambiance were amazing. The drinks were nice and food was ok. Service was good.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,2-Jul-23,5,Beijing Corn was so good me and my dad eat 5 tins a day (Translated from French)
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,28-Jun-23,5,"Oh my gosh best experience ever. I've been wanting to come for a while now and finally made it. The novelty and BATHROOMS in the gallery alone are worth it. Amazing food, amazing service, amazingness all around. Also pls if youre there, ask for Miguel. He has my whole heart"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,27-Jun-23,4,"The interior design was simply stunning, with its unique blend of modern and artistic elements. The attention to detail was evident in every corner, and the overall aesthetic created a truly enchanting atmosphere.

Now, let's talk about the desserts. Oh, my goodness! They were absolutely divine. Each dessert I tried was a work of art, both visually and in terms of taste. The chefs at Sketch truly know how to create desserts that are not only delicious but also visually stunning. Every bite was a burst of flavors, and I found myself savoring each and every moment.

One of the things that stood out to me about Sketch was how lively it was. The energy in the space was contagious, and it added a vibrant and lively vibe to the whole experience. The staff were friendly, attentive, and passionate about their craft. Their enthusiasm was infectious, and it made the entire visit even more enjoyable."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,27-Jun-23,4,"Sketch is an excellent choice for fine dining in the London area. Each section of this establishment houses a different ambiance and aesthetic style. There are a number of offerings: breakfast, lunch, dinner, bar, afternoon tea, etc. Just think about the time of day and how hungry you are, Sketch will provide!

I was impressed by the kindness of the hosts, variety of offerings, live music, and the blend of art, architecture, and food.

Upon entry to Sketch, I appreciated there being hosts present to greet and provide direction to guests, especially since Sketch is a rather large establishment divvied up into separate rooms/experiences. One of the hosts started conversation with a greeting and an inquiry for any dietary restrictions or allergies (much appreciated!), though we had none. We had a brief conversation after that, which set the tone for the experience. Honestly, when employees seem genuinely happy to interact with guests, beyond simple pleasantries, I take this as a positive first sign about the establishment itself.

As someone visiting London for the first time and wanting a selection of tea to try, my partner and I booked a reservation for Afternoon Tea at Sketch. We were able to try four different teas during our two and a half hour window. I recommend the Jasmine Silver Needle and Blackcurrant and Elderberry, especially if you're a fan of fruity or flowery flavors. Plus, the aroma of both is an added bonus to the experience.

The assorted sandwiches, petits gateaux, and scones gave me many a smile. Salmon and ricotta sandwich, yes please. Apricot eclair, delicious. Raspberry battenberg, beautiful and tasty. Scones, so rich and buttery. Of the variety, I did not enjoy the Redcurrant and Chocolate Macaron (the texture was not smooth or creamy, which I have come to expect from macarons), Cucumber Sandwiches (not enough cucumber and unfortunately, quite flavorless), and Citrus Tart (dry and hard - my teeth said no thank you).

The live music was excellent. I could not imagine anything better suited to an Afternoon Tea session than a live string trio playing covers of famous songs. Ever since the release of Bridgerton's first season, my partner and I have made a game of seeing who could be the first to ""Name that Song!"" He won, again. Some of the songs played included Running Up That Hill (by Kate Bush), Mr. Brightside (by The Killers), and There She Goes (by the La's).

Finally, if there is one thing I ask that you do when attending Afternoon Tea at Sketch, it is to use the restroom. Seriously: Get ready to be transported to another world. Since I don't want to give too much away, I'll just say... the chicken must have been ginormous."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,23-Jun-23,3,"Ambiance was incredible. I went to the fairy garden room for breakfast. Super well decorated rooms. Very instagrammable. The food was okay, I wasn't very impressed. Portions were small, but also prices weren't outrageously high. Overall I would go again"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,19-Jun-23,5,"Very delicious afternoon tea and artsy designs.
The whole experience started with an amazing experimental artsy website. Super fancy interior and there was a small orchestra trio playing in the dining room. The menu was super cute and the server would explain everything in detail. I loved their afternoon tea set -- the sandwiches were well flavored, sweets were super cute (a little too sweet), and the tea pairing was amazing (highly recommend the phoenix honey orchid for the roasted oolong with sweet aroma)! The cake in the end was not as up to standard though, which was a bit unsatisfying end."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,16-Jun-23,5,"Sketch Afternoon Tea in London is a whimsical experience that shouldn't be missed. From the moment you step into the restaurant, you're transported into a world of art and culinary wonders.

The afternoon tea menu includes a variety of finger sandwiches. The scones are freshly baked and served with clotted cream and preserves, adding a traditional touch to the experience. The pastries and desserts are delicately crafted and are a visual delight."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,3-Jun-23,5,"** Review for afternoon tea **

They have one of the most beautiful tea rooms I've ever seen! Definitely a must-visit place if you ever visit London.

Reservation is required and the afternoon tea is actually available starting from brunch time. The servers were very attentive and professional and they were very well dressed too

What I love most about the experience is that you can try unlimited number of tea/coffee/juices and the items on the tray is refillable as well. So definitely come with a big appetite!

Lastly, you've got to check out the washroom -- It's like the ultimate Instagram spot!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,1-Jun-23,4,"While in London we had dinner at Sketch - The Gallery. It was a beautiful spot, the atmosphere was definitely a big part of the restaurant. The staff were very attentive and came to check-in with us if we need anything pretty often. Though it was difficult to hear, a couple of the staff were quiet so it we did have to ask them to repeat themselves a couple of times. The drinks and appetizers were great, we ordered the Bavaroise of sand-grown carrots with aged balsamic vinegar and it was delicious. For my main I ordered the asparagus risotto, the risotto texture was perfect and overall I enjoyed the dish. One minor criticism was that I did find the dish a tad bit salty and as someone who enjoys salt it takes a lot for me to notice. Overall though we had a great experience and the food was very good. We would have checked one of the other rooms if we had time but had to head out for the night. I would recommend you check out this restaurant if you are in London and want to check out something different."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,29-May-23,5,My goodness. What a room (The Lecture Room and Library)! What an entrance! Food and wine are definitely a solid 3 star Michelin. Service is outstanding with minor glitches that only extremely judgmental people (like me!) would notice. Would absolutely recommend to anyone. Will return on my next trip to London.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,27-May-23,5,"Tea was amazing, insane, over the top and unforgettable. Service was top notch, great choices of teas, beautiful space, great tea-type foods (which are basically mayo-based things or sweet things), very cool dining area (as well as the rest of the place) and of course those crazy pod bathrooms.

Would gladly do the tea experience again and would definitely try the other dining areas of the place too. What an amazing and unique experience!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,27-May-23,3,"Beautiful ambiance every room is incredible. Service was really slow and I paid 120 pounds for one glass of champagne, sandwiches/pastries were ok. Worth the ambiance not food."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,26-May-23,5,"One of the best dining experiences I've ever had. Beautiful ambience and impeccable service. I enjoyed the filet which left me setting my fork down after each bite, as I needed a minute to contemplate how good food can really taste."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,17-May-23,1,"Had reservation for 830pm and they had us sit at 820pm. Ordered food around 830pm for our kids & for us. Asked server to get kids food started quickly if possible since kids were tired and about to sleep, they said ok. Every table around us that sat after us received their food, some even paid their bill and left. After an hour of waiting and seeing others get their food we stopped server to check on our order. Server said something but honestly couldn't understand because of music and their accent. Server never came to check on us to see if we wanted another drink etc. Also never brought the bread basket to the table that we ordered. The manager did happen to swing by the table in passing and say ""all good?"" Received our food 1 hour 10 min after being sat. By the time food came out our daughter had fallen asleep. We asked server to box her food but we were told they do not allow food to go due to 'safety concerns'??!. We explained we wanted to take her untouched food because she is 3yrs old and fell asleep waiting 1hr 10min for her food and they still said no. They removed her meal from the bill, however by the time we left it was 10:15 and no where was open for us to get food for her. We are visiting London and not able to go home and cook. To top it off we even put in our reservation we were celebrating our 10yr anniversary"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,17-May-23,1,"I usually don't do reviews. If I don't like it I just don't go back, but this is special because price and taste + service definitely is not matching. You are more than welcome to go Sketch If you wanna spend $150+ per person and get ok food & terrible service. Still can't believe how terrible they are. Definitely not going back."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,14-May-23,5,"Excellent high tea! Such a fun dining and sensual experience! From the live music to the delicious food, to the incredible decor ... just fantastic!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,13-May-23,5,"Wow- this by far was the most beautiful restaurant I've ever been to. There are several different dining rooms/experiences. All decorated differently- but equally beautiful. The entrance is enchanting.
The bathrooms!!!
We had breakfast, and the food was delicious and beautiful!!"

We had several entrees but the Pork Duck For Gras and the IrishBeef Fillet were outstanding. Lemon Panda Cotta was the wining dessert.

Lastly, you will feel like you are in a 70's science fiction skyrocket when you enter the spaceship like egg-pod lavatories complete with maid service and moving images circling the walls showcasing the cutting-edge feel. Enjoy!"

I think it is a perfect place to go with your partner and be able to get out of the monotony"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,9-May-23,5,"London's most iconic, artistic, and quirky teahouse, Sketch, is a the it spot for London tourists. From ballet dancers and extravagant desserts, you really have to experience her for yourself. The tea and sandwiches are served without limit and the starters are simply delicious. While I abhor the tea room's remodel from unique pink to dingy orange, hold your bladders because the toilet ""eggs"" are unlike anything other restroom in the world."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,4-May-23,5,This place is magical and whimsical it's so cool ! They have different rooms with different themes you can have a drink at . We sat in this 70's theme room and the drinks was beautiful . I had the drop it like it's hot and it was so tasty . Really nice place . Great for groups . The servers were very nice .They also have this really cool bathroom they are like pods . It's so cool

"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,28-Apr-23,5,Came here for tea at the recommendation of a coworker. I was looking for a place that didn't require my husband to wear a jacket. It was just fancy enough for him to wear a shirt and khakis and for me to wear a dress and tights. I was so surprised at how beautiful it was inside it was like an art gallery. All of the food and drink was delicious. Staff was very attentive. And we also got a string band to play for us during our tea. I left so stuffed! Thank you so much for a great first tea in London experience.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,28-Apr-23,4,"I had the afternoon tea which I enjoyed the experience more than the food. The service was exceptional, we were constantly checked up on and made sure our needs were met and the staff was accommodating as we could not finish our food and packed our extra courses away. They gave us extra macaroons and jam to take home. However, I personally felt that there were too many sweets vs savory items but I guess this is more for someone with a strong sweet tooth. But overall I enjoyed the experience and the setting of the restaurant is beautiful. The bathrooms are an experience themselves."

"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,21-Apr-23,2,"The service was great, the live string trio a nice touch. The ambiance crowded and a bit kitsch for us but ok. What we were very disappointed with was the quality of the food served for afternoon tea. The savory egg appetizer and finger sandwiches were good but it was downhill from there. The eclair, opera cake, and lemon battenberg were stale, like they'd been sliced in the morning and left to dry out (or even baked the day before). The macaroon disintegrated when biting into it (and was sickly sweet), and the creamy ginger concoction was served in a plastic glass with a plastic spoon. Seriously? The scone was in need of more tea to wash it down in spite of the average tasting strawberry jam and clotted cream, and by the time we got to the final slice of strawberry victoria cake we quickly realized it was stale as well and simply left it untouched. The martini and mango tango mocktail were also not above average. If you want really fancy afternoon tea go elsewhere, this was not worth the price by a longshot."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,14-Apr-23,5,"I absolutely LOVE this restaurant. The food is amazing. I ordered eggs and a croissant, and let me tell you, these were the best eggs I have ever had in my life!

The service was spot on and our waitresses name was Julia! She was so kind and helpful. The food also came very quickly.

The scenery... don't even get me started on how cool the inside was!!! This was by far one of the most unique restaurants I have ever been to! And not to mention... the bathrooms are so insane!! (You need to go to them lol)

Overall I definitely recommend Sketch!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,13-Apr-23,5,"Great service as well as amazing food! We had an amazing waitress named Julia, she was so sweet and welcoming. The restaurant was so cute and a great little spot to have some tea and more!

My wife found this place on Instagram and made us wake up early for it. But it was totally worth it!

You should definitely try this place out when you can!!!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,10-Apr-23,5,"Sketch is always a must-visit when going to London! We walked in on Easter Sunday in the hopes of getting a seat and we were lucky enough to get a table at the Parlour.

The service was great as usual, our order came very fast and they were able to accommodate additional people to our table. We had tea, dessert and the fish and chips. Everything was delicious, and the prices were reasonable.

It was our first time at the Parlour and it was a very nice vibe, much better than the gallery that they updated since we last dined. Of course we could not miss a selfie in the bathroom which we did at the end of our meal."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,10-Apr-23,3,Beautiful restaurant where every room has a different mood/theme. Service was impeccable! The food wasn't the best I've had especially at this price point but I'd say this is more of an Instagram and people watching type of restaurant.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,10-Apr-23,4,"We went for breakfast during the week. The place is amazing - every room is just spectacular. (Make sure to check out the downstairs bathroom, which is wild.)

The breakfast menu was limited, but all the dishes we had were very good. The non-alcoholic juice mixes were really good too.

Our one complaint: Once we were served, a waiter never came back to check on us, even though the room wasn't even close to full. We were trying to get butter and order an additional drink, but they never even looked our way once the food arrived.

All in all, a really cool, interesting place to eat that wasn't crazy expensive."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,8-Apr-23,4,It has a nice ambiance. Definitely a place made popular by social media people. The food is underwhelming at best. Maybe a good place for drinks but skip the food.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,28-Mar-23,4,"Quite the experience
The tea and food js not that amazing
But the decor is nice and creative not the best $400 i ever spent but im not regretting it"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,24-Mar-23,4,"I recently dined at Sketch restaurant in London and ordered the steak tartare, beef bourguignon, and pasta, along with an earl grey tea. Overall, I had a good experience at the restaurant. The tea cups were particularly enjoyable and added a touch of elegance to the meal. They were thin and had beautiful artwork on them.

The steak tartare was a standout dish for me. It was well-seasoned and the presentation was beautiful. However, the beef bourgignon was a bit disappointing. While it was certainly hearty and filling, it lacked the depth of flavor that I was hoping for. Similarly, the pasta was a bit underwhelming and tasted more like mac n cheese than a high-end pasta dish.

Despite the mixed experience with the food, I appreciated the chic ambiance and color overflow of the restaurant. Overall, I would recommend Sketch for its charming atmosphere and unique tea experience, but would suggest being selective with the menu choices."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,14-Mar-23,3,"We are in the gallery and it was definitely a unique experience that's unlike anywhere else I've eaten ... the food was good but not incredibly notable. Took a while to get drinks sometimes and had to follow up. Overall a cool experience to eat there once, but don't have a strong desire to go back."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,4-Mar-23,4,"I think this place is a teeny tiny bit overrated. I am a foodie and I thought this place is more about being seen (and photographed) than enjoying the food. The aesthetic is beautiful and funky but I thought for the price the food was nothing exceptional.
We went to the Gallery for dinner as it's the only reservations we could get 2 weeks prior, so that should probably have been an indication.
The price point is just too high for the creativity and quality. Perhaps the 75.00 pre-fixed afternoon tea is a better value. Anyway, it's a cool spot for sure to make Instagram post and TikToks."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,19-Feb-23,5,Amazing experience. It is more than just the meal it's an atmosphere that will effect all of your senses.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,18-Feb-23,1,"Like the biggest waste of money. People go there just for Instagram (including me) but I was still excited to try the food being the foodie I am. Got the risotto. No joke the worst meal I've ever eaten. Sadly, it tasted like dog water. To make matters better the bread they ""gave"" us was worse than a stale bread stick and it costed $13. You money is simply better spent anywhere else."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,16-Feb-23,5,"Breakfast in the parlour! The green garden room was beautiful. Came here right when it opened on a Tuesday in January.

The only regret I had was not being able to experience their afternoon tea. I was here only for a day's stopover :( As a result, no pink room or futuristic pod bathroom could be seen.

Got the 9 Conduit St Breakfast, the porridge, pear tart, flowering osmanthus, and even donated to a charity back then (only like a pound for Place2Be, not sure what it is now but saw it on my receipt). All pretty good. Everything was about 30 pounds back in 2017. So like a $36 breakfast! I heard there are no more pink chairs though, sadness. But yellow chairs instead? Or has that changed? Well, hopefully the next visit to London, I'd definitely aim to go here again during regular afternoon tea hours!"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,8-Feb-23,5,"We only had cocktails in the fairy forest bar, so I can only speak to the drinks, but yes! Such a great cocktail menu thoughtfully curated to support the aesthetic of the entire location. A mix of whimsy and modern, Sketch is definitely an interesting, entertaining place that shouldn't be missed. They recently changed out the main dining area from all pale pink to this mustard, and there are three different bar areas, each holds its own theme.
The food is French inspired and looks very good, but we decided to just do drinks at Sketch, then move on down the road.
Oh, and the toilets are individual pods.
So pee pods.
Get it?"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,7-Feb-23,5,I LOVE this place! Every time I'm in London it's a must. Afternoon tea and late night drinks are both fantastic!
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,5-Feb-23,3,"When you walk in it's very whimsical. We sat in the gallery room. There are a lot of people walking around and attending to tables, almost too many it at some points. The chairs are uncomfortable and heavy and mine wobbled so I had to ask someone to switch it out. I ordered oysters and scallops. It was unfortunate that they can't make any changes to dishes as I would have preferred the risotto but with some additional protein. The oysters were presented well, with dry ice, but were too large (I prefer less meat and a hugger salinity) and had an unnecessary slab of butter on each. The frozen mignonette they came with though, amazing. My scallops were mostly raw except for a seared top and the sauce they came with was good. I'm happy we got the bread as I would have left hungry but the bread was neither warm nor was it soft and the butter was hard and nothing special. Overall this place is a little too pretentious for me."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,27-Jan-23,5,"My wife booked us at the Gallery last night, which was an amazing experience. The ambiance showcases the bright hues of a cocktail room, reminiscent of a golden era. Filippo and the rest of the staff were very accommodating and attentive to our needs. They helped create a delicious meal from start to finish, paired with some good English sparking and wine. If you're looking for some great food with a relaxing vibe, the Gallery is the place to go. We are looking forward to returning to enjoy the Library experience later in the future."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,27-Jan-23,5,"Maybe the coolest restaurant we visited. The room for afternoon tea is really something else. Live music is perfect. Pretty decent amount of food here although everything is obviously very small. All prix fixe. Good sized champagne menu.

If it isn't obvious, this place is expensive. Be prepared so shell out $$$$ especially if you're drinking.

Would like to come back for lunch or a drink in one of the other rooms."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,12-Jan-23,5,"Sketch was a common thread in a few blogs I read about the best afternoon tea in London. Although I had a fantastic time at Sketch, I wouldn't say it was the best tasting afternoon tea food I've ever had. This title is reserved for a place I had in Malaysia. Nonetheless, Sketch is nearly a 5-star rating and deserves to be experienced at least once.

I totally get the appeal of the place. Sketch - in its entirety - was a feast for my eyes. They have multiple rooms that were eye-popping and/or avant garde. Even the bathrooms make a statement. GO SEE THE BATHROOMS.

I made reservations for afternoon tea in ""The Gallery"" at 12:30pm. This is the famous ""pink room"" that I read about. It was very elegant, and I loved the ambiance. The string trio (2 violinists and celloist) were phenomenal! They played contemporary music and were so good at it.

Customer service was excellent. Our server was so friendly and helpful. He was fairly attentive, but it wasn't hard to flag down someone if we needed assistance.

I could go down the menu list to describe everything I ate, but I'll summarize the food review on the favorite things I had.

The egg cream appetizer was incredible. I've never had anything like it. The texture was smooth and silky, and it had a bold, rich taste of egg yolk.

My favorite sandwiches were the smoked salmon and coronation chicken sandwiches. The smoked salmon tasted very fresh. I enjoyed the curry flavor of the coronation chicken.

I loved the mango tart and the desserts in the cups. There's sweet cream in both, which was the highlight of these desserts.

Lastly, Sketch made great scones. Personally I like clotted that's light and airy. The cream provided had the consistency of gelato."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,10-Jan-23,4,What a unique dining experience at Sketch. It feels like you're walking right into an Alice in Wonderland like world from the start. The ambience reminds me of a trippy Disney experience. Even the bathroom have included a fun twist. The wait staff were super polite and helpful throughout the night. The drinks were great and the food was top notch. The Risotto was the star of the evening. Super creamy and cooked very well. Definitely plan on visiting again while in London.
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,10-Jan-23,1,This is the worst meal I've ever had. Also extremely overpriced for nothing. The tea room is totally hyped up because of the decor but you could not pay me to go back and eat that meal. Don't be tricked!!
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,8-Jan-23,2,"First time at Sketch and found the atmosphere cold and unwelcoming. The staff at reception was more concerned with finding a way to turn would be patrons away rather than making customers feel welcome and appreciate their business. The staff came across as pretentious and uncaring and spent more time worrying about their appearance than in making customers have a memorable experience.

The food was bland and ordinary. The fishes lacked imagination as well as seasoning. The dishes came across as trying too hard and the service was lackluster and dry.

Not worthy of a second try."
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,6-Jan-23,5,"Okay this place is pretty awesome, expensive but awesome! We went here to see what afternoon tea is about and could not pass up on a reservation to SKETCH! So iconic with the pink room. Presentation of food, decor, and customer service was outstanding!

Afternoon tea here is pricey especially with champagne, but the food and tea itself is unlimited. The finger sandwiches were small but so delicous. We only did got seconds on a few sandwiches and desserts, we were shock at how full we both were! We couldn't finish all of it so they were kind enough to pack our goodies into boxes, the scones and clotted cream with jam was the best thing I ever ate; so simple! We spent about 350 USD$ for two people, one person got champagne. If I was here again I would ask for 10 scones to take home.

We came during Christmas (highly recommend) the theme of the food was so festive! We also had a ballerina come out and dance it was so lovely!

If you're looking for a special treat"
"Sketch, The Lecture Room & Library",3,2-Jan-23,5,"After eating at four Michelin three-star restaurants in the past few months this was the best. First of all, the Lecture Room is like something out of a Fellini movie. A large Pegasus dominates the room. It is filled with bright colors and looks like an amusement park. The festive aspect of the room carries out to the service. Everyone is happy and pleased to be of service. Then there is the food. Off the charts. There was not a dish that did not receive a high standard. The food was beautiful, but most of all it was flavorful. And just the right balance so that the flavors did not mix together but held their own distinctive flavor. You can taste all of the various notes in each bite. The price point, too, was a bargain. We had four courses for lunch at 125 pounds each. It included a bottle of wine too. With tax it was 288 pounds. Among the many one-, two- and three-star restaurants, this Sketch offered the best value for the money. One note, there is also a vegetarian option and a vegetarian restaurant and bar below. All are festive and fun."
The Ledbury,2,27-Jun-24,5,"Fantastic!

The food was amazing, every course.

An airy but warm space, reasonable room between tables.

They easily accommodated my aversion to sweetbreads and even changed the wine pairing.

Service was perfect. Courteous and attentive.

They organized a taxi for me, perfectly timed so that I had no wait after paying the bill.

I highly recommend The Ledbury. It's my new favorite restaurant in London.

"
The Ledbury,2,3-Mar-24,5,"Simply incredible!!!

We dined at lunch and chose the 8-course menu with wine pairing.

EXQUISITE experience"
The Ledbury,2,22-Apr-23,5,"Been wanting to come here for a very long time and glad we finally made it. Four of us came for dinner and all of us walked out with big smiles. The evening was exquisite, service on point, friendly and funny staff and food that was exceptionally good and not a single course I did not like.

I had told them about our food restrictions before hand and they had individual menus prepared for each person, that alone is worthy of three stars. Their attention to detail is really amazing here. The food started arriving and course after course was amazing flavour, fabulous presentation, and the staff were just great with us in responding to our questions and elaborating as needed. My favourites of the night were the charcuterie that comes from their farm, the Portland crab, the venison from their farm, their home grown mushrooms and the mackerel. The dessert was nice but the pralines that came with the coffee put me on cloud 9 :-) the truffle praline was exquisite to say the least. They even gave me a small bag of those to take home, that's very special.

Great but expensive wine list, exceptional service and we never had to ask for anything during the evening and service with a smile. Loved every bit of this place and I would come back in a heartbeat. I was apprehensive considering I had been waiting a long while to get here but, they delivered beyond expectation."
The Ledbury,2,29-Mar-23,5,had a lovely evening here. menu was the tasting menu. nice selection of wines. service is impeccable.
The Ledbury,2,13-Nov-22,5,Amazing dinner! Nicest staff! The wine pairing was especially fun and I highly recommend it.
The Ledbury,2,27-Oct-22,4,"Just got through with dinner. Nice airy yet small restaurant in a quaint neighborhood in Notting Hill.

Tasting menu was $145 GBP so about $219 USD per person. They offer 8 items. We choose the 6 item menu as there were a couple of items on the menu I'm not fond of.

The appetizers were delicious. Melt in your mouth delicious. The service was what you'd expect from a 2 Michelin star restaurant. Prompt, knowledgeable and very professional.

The sommelier was friendly and a perfect fit for The Ledbury. The ONLY reason we're giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the size of the portions of wine. They're literally tasting size yet you're charged for a full glass. They're not even a quarter of a glass. I've never seen anything like it. Coming from California and visiting Napa regularly we found this disappointing.

I hope they revisit that as I'm positive we're not the first people to comment on this. The wine selections were good but not worth the money if you decide to buy just a glass and not a bottle

Other than that try this restaurant. The food it wonderful."
The Ledbury,2,24-Aug-22,5,"Fantastic dishes recently came here for lunch.
The dish was top-notch and had a decent taste in addition to being incredibly delicious and amazing. Fresh fish as well as salads.
Our lunch was delivered quickly and with good service.
The setting was wonderful inside as well as outside. good atmosphere We had a satisfying meal here. Most likely, we'll return."
A.Wong,2,7-Apr-24,5,"The biggest problem with eating dim sum is: there could be too many delicious bites to describe.

The restaurant itself is pretty big, maybe 60 seats including a dozen at the bar, and almost every seat was full during my weekday prixe-fixe lunch.

The servers were knowledgeable and personable... and busy.  A small new item arrived in front of me about every 5 minutes, plus the wines.

And the food was excellent: the ""999 layered scallop puff,"" was technically exacting, and beautifully presented...

The ""Memories of Peking Duck,"" was also delicious, although I can't ever remember having shaved truffle and caviar on my Peking duck... my local Cantonese restaurant must be in a more ""working class"" neighborhood.

The problem, of course, is everyone, including me, loves each bite, and wants more... but doesn't want to wait for the next visit. 

2024 04 30. M2."
A.Wong,2,2-Apr-24,4,"Food 4.5/5.0
Service 4.0/5.0
Value 3.0/5.0
Decor 4.0/5.0
Overall 4.5/5.0

Very cool spot in what has become a not-that-cool part of town. The dinner prix fixe pricing was certainly not shy, but the courses were aplentiful and felt okay. A bit disconcerting that few if any diners appeared to be Chinese, though the profile of the kitchen was comforting. The courses are designed to take the diner through certain regions of China. The food in general was reasonably creative and quite delish. Glad to see good Chinese food in town. Would love to come back for dim sum one day."
A.Wong,2,14-Oct-23,4,"We made a reservation here for a la carte lunch, and it was a wonderful experience, but not all of the food was a total hit. Everything is priced by the piece, so it does add up.

I definitely had some favorites and some I wouldn't order again, but everything was beautifully plated and I had a wonderful experience. One of my favorites was the scallop cheung fun. They had such unique and innovative plays on traditional dim sum food. Like the shumai and har gao were even done differently than usual (and done extremely well!!).

The service was also quite nice, but I did have to get their attention a couple times to notice I needed a refill on my tea. The restaurant itself was set up in an interesting way. If you arrive early, they take you to a waiting area in their basement which is quite interesting. However, I'm not a fan of their outdoor dining section--it feels a little makeshift and doesn't feel as upscale as what you might expect a 2 Michelin star place to feel like.

I'd love to come back here to do the tasting menu for dinner as I hear it's a bit different from the lunch menu. Overall, will likely be back, but it is pricey with some hits and misses, so won't be a regular occurrence."
A.Wong,2,2-Jul-23,5,"It's been 3 months since I visited A. Wong, and the duck yolk custard bun still lives rent free in my mind. I think about it daily and look forward to my next visit."
A.Wong,2,24-Mar-23,5,What an incredible experience. Tashi and Matthew gave my mother and I an incredible dim sum experience. This restaurant is worth every Michelin star.
A.Wong,2,28-Nov-22,2,"Food: unnecessarily fussy
Service / ambiance: far from 2 Michelin worthy
Value: very subpar

I would not eat here again or recommend that anybody does for the price they charge. How this place got a Michelin star let alone two, I'll never know. The experience is just not worth the money, time, or distinction. Was it bad? Far from. It was perfectly okay. But okay is many steps from 2 Michelin stars or 225 pounds per person.

Strike 1: being locked out of the restaurant on arrival. 5pm seating reservation, arrived at 4:55 and was sent out in the cold bc they weren't ready as if we were the strange ones for being basically on time. 2 other parties arrived while we waited, all equally as confused, and they let us in late. Odd to make that first impression. Any other restaurant would welcome us in to wait at the bar with a drink in hand or something.

Strike 2: being sat basically outside in the makeshift enclosed terrace space. The draft every time someone opened the door. The streetside smoke that wafted in. The little lawn chairs, practically, that we sat in. Not at all the cozy and comfortable hospitality you'd expect.

That's before the food actually began to arrive.
I really wanted to like this food. We just ate at ATOMIX where they masterfully elevate korean cuisine and I wanted so much to see the same done for Chinese food. But it was very much showing technique for the sake of technique, fussiness for the sake of fussiness, but also ends up being a jack of all trades, master of none t type of situation.

I had a mediocre lukewarm soup dumpling. A mediocre cold tiny helping of Tofu pudding, a muffled down version of Yunnan raw beef salad, hand pulled noodles that got fried (but you typically eat that for the texture, not to be just shown a video of the technique??).. Basically all things you'd get for much better at a regular restaurant that specializes in these regions,at a fraction of the price. The dining experience here and the versions of these dishes didn't elevate the original dish with technique (in fact the original dishes are simple, humble but very technique heavy), did not provide a point of view from the chef, and was not anchored by and did not portray an authentic experience from the chef. These are the reasons you eat at a 2 Michelin star restaurant for many times the price. A wong's menu did not deliver.

the actual service - It was not rude, but also was a little clumsy, disingenuous, and impersonal. The backservers were actually super sweet but they were not trained for the elevated dining style. I personally don't care about service etiquette at all, but the stark contrast between the roles is kind of jarring. Probably the worst service we had in London and at the nicest restaurant we booked. I would just prefer a polished concept at least to be deserving of the price tag.

This was the most disappointing meal in our 2 week trip to Europe. Sadly a wong did not properly elevate Chinese cuisine to the western stage, in my view as a Chinese-American diner."
A.Wong,2,11-Aug-22,1,"Typically, I wouldn't write about a restaurant that I didn't like, but A. Wong--the Chinese restaurant outside of China with the most Michelin stars--was that much of a crushing disappointment. With waiting lists until November, my mom and I literally ran across London when we got a call that they could squeeze us in.

Alas, the food just wasn't that good. For every dish, we could think of a significantly cheaper restaurant in China that could do better. We could make better-tasting food. With every dish served, we grew more anxious for the meal to be over.

A. Wong's issue is not 'inauthenticity,' which may be a concern for some diners. We have loved Chinese fusions and creative dim sum before. But unique is not always preferable, as evidenced by their xiao long bao soup that simply tasted off. Attempts to be innovative fell flat with overly salty or sour aftertastes, and gimmicks like a crunch on top of the xiu mai, or painting our peking duck wraps with a paintbrush, added little to the actual flavor, leaving us very much unmoved. Even dishes where flavors were ok, like the DIY lamb buns, could not possibly justify their price (for 肉夹馍, Murger Han is an option that provides far better value).

While some dishes were 'too' creative, others were the definition of mediocrity. The tofu starter or the beef rice bowl main were laughably pretentious -- a spot-the-difference game between generic Chinese food and supposed fine dining. The pickled vegetables atop the tofu could have been store-bought 涪陵榨菜; the so-called spicy wagyu beef mixture under the corn starter was suspiciously reminiscent of 老干妈. A restaurant whose flavors are either unpleasant or unexceptional is hardly deserving of the praise that A. Wong has garnered.

The best restaurants are good because their food is truly original and memorable, not just aesthetically interesting. A. Wong offers nothing special in flavor, service, or environment, yet is exorbitantly priced. Our repeated lamentation of the night was: what were you thinking, Michelin?

Claude Bosi at Bibendum,2,18-Jul-24,4,"Located on the ground floor of one of the most beautiful and ornate buildings in all of London, The Bibendum Oyster Bar was a very nice place for an early pre-show bite to eat. Service and food do not quite live up to the surroundings, but the casual vibe, nice wine list and very good food were exactly what we wanted. In particular, the fish and chips main course was an elevated version of the British staple and excellent! Recommend."
Claude Bosi at Bibendum,2,13-May-24,1,"Unethical. vicious. unscrupulous, dishonorable - I'm trying to think of words that can properly encapsulate the unacceptable behaviors of this ""Michelin starred"" establishment and the adjectives I listed above cannot adequately denounce the horrendous actions committed by Claude Bosi. Think of someone who might try to push old ladies down stairs and post Instagram pics of the act - and then you're getting close. Think of the guy who beats baby seals to bottle the tears and then you're probably close to the moral compass of this circus act.

My wife became ill this morning. I called Claude Bosi to see if I could move, cancel or reschedule and avoid their 165£/pp charge. Unfortunately no one answers the phones there. I called 7 times. Nothing. I leave a voicemail them asking them for assistance. Nothing. Not giving up, I write an email and ask them to call me. Nothing. Suddenly 5 minute after leaving a voicemail I see them cancel my reservation on OpenTable and then charge me for 165£ twice. Luckily I was traveling and my card thought it was fraud and declined the charge. 45 minutes later a charge for 330£. Same declined charge. I call again. Nothing. I left my phone number on both the email and voicemail. They haven't called. It's still 5 minutes before my reservation but they are hell bent on charging me for a reservation that I have yet to cancel -that in both the voicemail and email where I was asking for help to discuss options. Instead they won't even call. They callously cancel a reservation 2 hours while relentlessly attempting to wield a punishment on a customer with a sick family member. If you want to go here, knock yourself out. Don't think they have an ounce of empathy. They'll likely spit in your food or use other bodily fluids to inflict punishment if things go awry. Bon a petit. I hope the Michelin review is reading. If not, I'll spread the love on Google."
Claude Bosi at Bibendum,2,16-Dec-23,4,Great no frills fresh seafood. I ate downstairs but inside which was still cold in winter. But would do so again
Claude Bosi at Bibendum,2,8-Dec-23,1,"I was really looking forward to trying this restaurant after passing by the historic building which was a draw.I made a reservation at the oyster bar on a weeknight.

They have another posh restaurant on the upper floor of this establishment which apparently has earned two Michelin stars.

Bibendum oyster Bar, on the street level, is the step sister of the fancier restaurant above. The French vinyl bistro chairs were quite uncomfortable. I was seated next to an Australian couple who were engaging and they took the edge off the poor food experience. Perhaps Claude should come down stairs once in a while to check on his staff in the Oyster bar kitchen because what they are sending out is truly disappointing. I ordered a pasta dish with crabmeat , the pasta was so undercooked it was crunchy, there was hardly any crabmeat in the dish and it was COLD. The squid was Just laying there in a pool of sauce that was bland. The fish I ordered was hardly seasoned and only on one side; it was void of any flavor with a crust on one side ~ no creativity, garnishes, or sides... bad presentation and a total letdown.

There were some cute touches like butter dishes that looked like ashtrays with a porcelain Michelin man sitting on the side. And, there were lots of vintage ""Michelin"" tire posters & memorabilia...The building truly has a lot of history & character, which is what lured me in originally. The oyster bar left me disappointed. I doubt I would return to this place. You don't mind paying good money for good food but you will mind paying good money for bad food."
Claude Bosi at Bibendum,2,1-Dec-23,5,"A beautiful, delicious, fun dining experience! The ingredients were super fresh, and with just the right amount of decadence (e.g., foie gras, caviar, etc). The service here was also impeccable. Our menu (£185 each) was:
1) Bread
2) Foie gras ice cream - this dish was amazing. Like eating light fluffy clouds of foie
3) French onion soup
4) Bortaga caviar tart
5) Bibendum egg with cucumber compote and toasted sunflower seeds
6) Duck jelly with white onion, smoked sturgeon, and Petrossian Daurenki caviar
7) Cornish turbot à la Grenobloise
8) Brittany rabbit with Scottish langoustine, and French tarragon
9) Rabbit liver tartlet
10) Foie gras (which we ordered as extra), with crème caramel, cumin, and Macvin Japanese pear
11) Sake katsu with anise ice cream
12) 100% Chocolate soufflé cake"
Claude Bosi at Bibendum,2,15-Aug-23,5,"I can across this place while on a long walk from downtown to Chelsea/Kensington area.

The hosts were gracious. Food was delicious. Building was stunning."
Claude Bosi at Bibendum,2,28-Oct-22,5,"NOTE: This review for the 2-Michelin starred Claude Bosi restaurant on the second level, not the oyster bar on the ground level.

I am actually quite surprised this place has just 2 Michelin stars and not 3. Every single bite of this multi course experience was ethereal... magnificent. Every. Bite.

It all started with some wonderful amuse bouches: a savory mini cake and a beautifully presented egg dish that was so delicious, I was literally trying to scrape every bit of it out of the shell.

The next dish - Duck Jelly - simply blew my mind. First of all, when the server lifted the cloche, I was in awe of how absolutely stunning it was, visually (see photos.) Then, when I took that first bite, I did that thing where my eyes automatically close so I can focus on savoring everything happening in my mouth... the unique cool, creaminess and the oh-so-interesting gelatinous layer... and the flavor payoff just soared. How on earth did they get so much rich, intense duck flavor in that jelly? My mind couldn't comprehend, but it was simply magnificent.

The meat pie was delicious as well - a strong French twist on a British classic. The pastry was flaky, and when I cut into a piece, you could see the gorgeous juices flowing out of the meat. Even the salad... I wish I would've asked how they dressed it... even THAT made me do that eye closing thing.

The beautifully presented cheese course and the lovely sweets were the perfect ending to a perfect meal.

By the way, their service was so special. Everyone was so incredibly warm and welcoming. I love when the staff makes you feel as though you are genuinely a welcomed guest in their home... that's how they made me feel at Claude Bosi.

Michelin team, you need to revisit this one!!! Hint: 3!"
Claude Bosi at Bibendum,2,20-Apr-22,5,Enjoyed the service and food at this location. It is a nice little restaurant in the Chelsea neighborhood. I ordered the crab linguine and my husband had the cheese burger. Both was delicious. We washed our wine down with the house white wine. Definitely recommend if you are close by. The staff were very friendly.
Claude Bosi at Bibendum,2,4-Apr-22,5,"First of all: Claude Bosi is the Michelin restaurant on the first floor. Bibendum is the oyster / cocktail bar on the ground floor spilling out into the street. While both are housed in this beautiful, original HQ for Michelin UK, almost all the poor Yelp reviews are directed at the downstairs cocktail bar.

It has been a while since I've been to the restaurant (Covid), there does seem to be a few small changes change since winning their 2 stars, five years ago.

The decor, food and service are still excellent.

But there seems to be a bit more formality. When the restaurant first opened, I remember that the servers didn't even wear ties, ""in an effort to encourage new patrons to enjoy fine dining,"" or some such logic. I guess that didn't work.

Also, I am glad to see that they have removed the 1920's Michelin advertisement posters which could only been positively described as, ""a bit culturally insensitive.""

In any case, I will surely return on my next stop in London.

Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,14-Mar-24,4,"Yum! We were looking forward to different flavors while visiting London. We were able to get a late lunch reservation, so it was very quiet. Service started out great and everyone was attentive. After we finished our first glass of wine, we had to wave to get the attention of another server because our original server was now gone? Service after that was mediocre.

The food was good, although I am not sure we would go back due to the price and service. You get to choose between the Adventurer, Guide and Maverick, however, we had a very difficult time understanding what they were saying. In the beginning we asked them to repeat the description of the course, and then gave up. Restaurant is inside the beautiful Mandarin Oriental."
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,23-Oct-23,5,"Heston Blumenthal is a legend. Trying his triple cooked chips alone was worth the price of admission. Having said that, the food was not the best I have ever had.

The ambience was great. The service was good but once we were finished, they forgot about us and I had to finally wave at someone to bro g us the bill.

Overall, I would probably try other Michelin star restaurants rather than returning. But if you've never been, you should try it."
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,19-Sep-23,2,"This is a good restaurant. However, it is entirely incongruous with its promise. It has two Michelin stars and is priced accordingly. It has pomp and pride you'd really only find elsewhere at the French Laundry.

The food is OK. There is absolutely no way that this food would get a single star in the US, France, or Italy. But it's good food. I will go further--for all I know, this may very well be the best food in the UK, but that's not a terribly high bar."
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,28-Jun-23,5,"Unanimously, our favorite meal this trip was lunch at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal. The menu reads like a brief history of English food, with dishes dating back to the 14th century. For that signature H.B. whimsy, we were given cards, not unlike those you'd find in a tarot deck, that dictate how much engagement we'd like from the waitstaff. After this first flirtation, I'm jonesin' for more Heston Blumenthal in my life.

The dishes I ordered came from the vegetarian menu; it had a version of Rice & Flesh (c. 1390) I could stomach, substituting artichoke (one of my favorite veggies) for the sweetbread & smoked eel in the original recipe. For starters, I had The Truffle (c. 1500), a mushroom parfait coated in truffles which spread like butter on a delicious piece of grilled toast. Like the Meat Fruit dish they're known for (chicken liver spread shaped into a mandarin), The Truffle is meant to look like something it isn't.

We split three desserts: Tipsy Cake (c. 1858) which takes over an hour to prepare so order this pineapple & brioche dish upfront; Sambocade (c. 1390), a goat's milk cheesecake; & the one I now constantly yearn for, Chocolate Bar (c. 1730), which is filled with a decadent passionfruit jam & topped with gold flakes. Exquisite, every single one of 'em.

It's easy to see how & why Dinner by Heston Blumenthal maintains their coveted two Michelin stars. Our waiter & those assisting him were all so lovely. The restaurant gives you a view of the kitchen on one side & a gorgeous English garden on the other. And, of course H.B.'s imagination & creativity is unparalleled. I'm planning my next London trip around when I can get a reservation to his other restaurants, & that's no hyperbole."
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,27-May-23,5,"Overall a fine meal, food was pretty good-good, nothing really outstanding or over the top. The a la carte menu is nice, as are the stories about the dishes. The space is pretty dramatic with high ceilings and an ""open"" kitchen behind glass.

Service is hit or miss, it can be slow and water cups weren't regularly filled. But once our food started coming the meal was pretty well paced. The cocktails and wine were decent.

The experience is not on par with 2 star restaurants, but neither is the price (feels cheap!). This is closer to a 1 star michelin but I assume holds 2 because of the name and location. Not a bad meal, just not somewhere I'm itching to go back to.

must try restaurant imo!

The meat fruit and tipsy cake are both classics and must orders. Enough has been said about them so I'm not gonna pile on but let's just say I had really high expectations and they didn't disappoint

In our ongoing quest to eat at every Michelin restaurant we can possibly afford, we had dinner at..... Dinner. We ordered the tasting menu, as one must, and I will admit to being a little fearful of what we'd be eating, since the menu is a riff on ancient English recipes.

Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,13-Mar-23,5,"Located in the opulent Mandarin hotel, this restaurant provided me with a memorable dining experience while visiting in London. Though the dishes are elegant and modern, they are rooted and inspired by historic British cuisines so be prepared for that. We elected for the tasting menu as opposed to the a la carte, and felt full by the end.

When you were seated, you are given three large cards by the host, which allow you to A.) Sit in silence and enjoy the dishes, B.) Dive into the preparations and details of what you're eating, or C.) Learn the history behind the dish. You can obviously change the card throughout the dinning experience, but we found C to be the most fun in discovering the history behind each of these dishes that were brought back from the past with modern re-invention.

In addition to the food, they have a great list of wines available, as well as three wine pairing options to choose from (Classic, Premium, Prestige). We chose the Premium and Classic, which had a nice variety of bubbles/wine to pair with the meals. Highly recommend you give this place a try at least once the next time you're in London!"

Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,5-Jan-23,4,"We went for lunch service over the holidays and had a decent experience. The restaurant was empty when we entered and filled up about 70% by the time we left around two. We sat at a nice table facing Hyde Park.
We ordered a la carte to try more variety of dishes between the two of us. The signature dishes were good (meat fruit and tipsy cake at the end). Tipsy cake is literally a bed of butter so probably a heart attack! The confit chicken and scallops were both good as starters. The ribeye was your typical ribeye with fries, nothing special at all. Expected more out of a Heston slab of steak. The squab was good but smaller pieces on the bone rather than cuts of just meat.
Lastly, the service was just ok for a two Michelin star restaurant. Plenty of servers, but most were standing around trying (and failing) to look busy. The floor supervisors were busy. Would we come back? Yes. Would this be our first choice to eat? No."

We ordered the tasting menu, as one must, and I will admit to being a little fearful of what we'd be eating, since the menu is a riff on ancient English recipes. We all know England isn't known for its cuisine, now or at any point in history. The descriptions made me very nervous. Thankfully my fears were completely unfounded. Every course was an absolute delight. In particular, the pineapple dessert, was insanely delicious.

We also ordered the wine pairing package, which was full of thoughtful and unique pairings. Unfortunately, the wine pairing is where they are losing a star from me. These had to have been the stingiest pours I've ever had from a Michelin-level wine pairing. The wines being served were not extremely expensive wines, so we felt like this pairing package was not worth the expense, which is probably the first time we have *ever* felt that way about a wine pairing at a Michelin dine. And that's saying something.

Other than that, the interior was jaw-dropping gorgeous. They have a card system where you can indicate the level of interaction you want to have with the staff surrounding your dishes and wines, which I thought was a very nice touch. All in all, I do highly recommend this restaurant, but skip the skimpy wine pairing and just buy your own bottle--or-two-- and get what you actually pay for.

Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,7-Dec-22,4,We had the a la carte menu for dinner; the meal had a British food influence. A very pleasant evening with very good service.
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,6-Nov-22,2,"I hate to give such a low rating to such a lovely restaurant and staff but if we were just basing this on the food, three stars would be generous.

Let's start with the positives. I liked the restaurant and atmosphere. Located in the Mandarin Oriental hotel, it was classy but not at all stuffy. The staff were friendly and attentive without being overbearing or pretentious. The wine selection was great. The chicken liver parfait was good and the fries were excellent, the fries or 'chips' I should say, were some of the best I've ever had (even better than the duck fat fries at Stripsteak in Mandalay Bay). The plating was also beautiful and the pace was good.

Now the bad: The beef was borderline terrible. It was chewy to the point of being sinewy. The sauce was delicious but this was a ribeye cut, with little to no fat. Even grass fed ribeye cuts I've had contain more fat and were far more tender than these slices. To the kitchen's credit, the beef was cooked to a perfect medium-rare. However, of course, the perfect medium-rare cooking only accentuated the terrible quality of the meat.

Since the ribeye was our main course, this was a letdown.

The remaining dishes were not particularly memorable. There was a quail dish with smoked consommé, the consommé had a sweetness and tanginess that tasted disjointed from the quail. Their famous tipsy cake was mostly good but really sweet, couldn't take more than a few bites.

Decades ago, by some featured restaurant article that now eludes my memory, The Fat Duck was not only ranked the best restaurant in England but the world. I've wanted to try it ever since I first read about it. When I heard the same chef had opened this restaurant in London, which was way more convenient for a tourist such as myself to visit, I had to try it.

If my bill were cut into half or a third, it wouldn't sway my opinions about how much I didn't enjoy the dishes. At 1/2 or 1/3 the price, it would merely incite bewilderment, I'd think, ""how could they afford so much staff and time plating such delicious looking dishes at 1/2 or 1/3 what we paid in such a venue?""

Conclusion? Maybe too much spent on ancillary benefits and not enough on the food."
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,17-Oct-22,5,10/10 recommend. This was our first time at a 2 star Michelin and it did not disappoint. Every bite was full of carefully crafted flavors. The experience was just magnifiqué. They boast meals from 13th century England and beyond with a twist. I had the duck and it melted in my mouth. It was so good I had to pause a moment and just savor it before swallowing. The atmosphere is a subtle nod to that old English time period and you can choose how you want your meal explained (if at all). If you ever have the chance you MUST visit.
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,23-Aug-22,1,"I didn't expect that there would be cheating on consumers in the Michelin two-star restaurant. The sommelier recommended a bottle of 2012 Italian red wine that was not on the wine list. When we asked the price, he replied that it was 650 pounds. All six of us at the table clearly heard that it was six fifty, but when we checked out, he said it was 6500 pounds"
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,19-Aug-22,5,"A great 2 star michelin restaurant.
Great food, very creative.
Almost every dish had a twist. The bread was amazing.
Wine pairing (premium) wss superb
And the service was friendly and professional"
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,7-Aug-22,3,"Not quite sure how Dinner has two Michelin stars. To my thinking, a Michelin star rating should be indicative of not just excellent food, but also of excellent service and elevated atmosphere. The food, service and atmosphere were good, but they were not exemplary.

The first issue was that our servers, although very nice, were more often than not rather difficult to understand, due to quite heavy accents of unknown origins. This made grasping the rather silly and unnecessary tarot card presentation at the meal's start somewhat tricky. We opted for ""adventurer"", which means ""bring the food and we'll eat it, no lengthy explanations."" Not sure what the other three options were.

The food itself was fine. But at no point during the meal did I ever think ""OMG this is amazing! I've never tasted anything quite like it! I would come back and just order a massive dish of that!""

The flavors were well executed, but not very unique. Presentation was competent, but on the basic side. With the exception of the meat fruit, no one dish stood out as unforgettable, unlike multiple dishes I've had at places like Blue Hill in NYC or Chicago's Alinea.

I don't need dinner to be an Andrew Lloyd Weber production, but the steak medallion we were served at Dinner, while nicely cooked and tasty, sat lonely on a bare plate, and was served warmish, not hot.

While the meat fruit was excellent, it came with a large slab of bread, as did the ""truffle"". That would have been fine, but these were the very first course, served immediately after the bread service that we ate while waiting for the first course. Had we known there'd be so much bread, we might have passed on the bread course.

The restaurant itself was a mixture of opulent oddity and uninspired. A private dining area was quite inviting, as was the chef's table. But the rest of the place, while comfortable, wasn't transportive or anything I'd call luxurious, unlike many other Michelin star places we've been. The bar was interesting looking, but rather dead for a Friday night, and the bottles were behind some sort of odd glass cage, so you couldn't easily browse the selection for inspiration. Overall, the space somehow just lacked the magic of places like Daniel or Le Bernardin.

The worst aspect of dinner at Dinner was the duration. and the lag between courses. The pace started off ok, but by the last 3 dishes, we were waiting 15-20 minutes between servings, while food came rushing out all around us. By the end of the meal, all the other diners around us, who'd arrived around the same time as us or later, had left. The entire meal clocked in at nearly 2.5 hours.

All in all, a decent meal that was excessively long, in a comfortable but underwhelming environment. No need to return."
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,13-May-22,5,"A must try restaurant imo!

The meat fruit and tipsy cake are both classics and must orders. Enough has been said about them so I'm not gonna pile on but let's just say I had really high expectations and they didn't disappoint.

My sea bass main was perfectly cooked. The side of fries was perfectly crispy on the outside and soft inside.

The dining experience can be customized as well depending on how much you want to learn about the food, it's history, or just have a quiet meal.

Amazing. Definitely gonna try and come back again the next time I visit London."
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,24-Apr-22,1,Dinner took 5 hours to get through all of the courses. Could've passed on all of the fish courses. Not sure why they insisted on presenting every course to each diner at the same time. Food was not worth the wait or pageantry.
Dinner by Heston Blumenthal,2,15-Mar-22,5,"Located in Mandarin Continental, DHB is a top notch dining experience. Inspired by traditional British dishes and truly reinvented, light, upscale and tasteful. Service was warm and professional. The salamagundi chicken confit was savory with crispy skin, fillet de beef perfectly prepared, the crisps apparently takes 24 hours to prepare and mushroom ketchup predates tomato ketchup, rainbow trout with green sauce was light and paired well with the chenin blanc. Dessert tipsy cake should be ordered early, and if your waiter is a wizard, would have predicted that you would order it and held one for you, ice cream is made with liquid nitrogen at the table side. Cap off with sambuca.

Kitchen Table,2,16-Nov-23,5,"My favourite restaurant in London. James deserves his third michelin star and I can unquestionably confirm the best somellier in London. Cheap at twice the price, worth a special visit"
Kitchen Table,2,1-Nov-23,5,"This dining experience was a gift to my husband and I from my sister and brother in law to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. What a wonderful way to celebrate! Dinner at this restaurant was a four hour occasion that thrilled and entertained us without being too pretentious or uncomfortable. The courses came in perfect timing and watching the kitchen staff and chef in the kitchen was such an added treat. We were able to see the care that went into each detail. My favorite two courses were the lobster and pumpkin dishes, least favorite mylor shrimp. The wine pairings complimented the dishes well and were explained with detail. The chef was delightful and interacted with us the guests very comfortably. The staff was attentive, friendly, and accommodating. I loved the way we were eased into dinner and eased toward the finish both in the lounge, never feeling rushed or unwelcome. This experience was one of the highlights of my trip to Europe. Highly recommend!!

"
Kitchen Table,2,16-Oct-23,5,"My friend and I had a lovely 4+ hour experience here at The Kitchen Table. The staff was very personable and funny. The bathrooms were very nice and the staff was very accommodating for any dietary allergies. My tablemate's alternative meals looked better than the regular menu sometimes!

It was very cool to see all of the food being prepared in front of you and I think you appreciate the flavors better that way instead of a regular dining experience.

We had skipped breakfast and lunch and still came out incredibly full. Everything was very delicious. What I really appreciated was the non-alcoholic pairing and how much thought they put into it. I got the whole sommelier experience but for sodas and juices instead of wine! I've been to a few Michelins and this was a first.

Overall, I would strongly recommend this to anyone visiting London."
Kitchen Table,2,21-Mar-23,5,"im not going to write too much. I had high expectations for this 2 Michelin restaurant and Kitchen Table did not disappoint. 4 hours of amazing food, drinks, and atmosphere. yes, it's very pricey. but this is one of those meals I will continue to think about as I grow older."
Kitchen Table,2,28-Jul-22,5,"I had high expectations, and Kitchen Table greatly exceeded them. The food here was fantastic - fresh, creative, and delicious. Chef James Knappett worked magic right before our very eyes. I loved the open kitchen concept and the theater-style seating. The service was also impeccable. Every staff member was incredibly gracious and welcoming.

Best of all, the restaurant didn't feel stuffy at all. Contrary to what you might normally expect from a two Michelin starred restaurant, Chef Knappett playfully chastised me after I stirred one of my sauces two times after he had instructed us to stir just once. He then pointed to a tiny flower petal that was still on my plate and said ""that's edible."" I loved the playfulness and irreverence.

The entire meal took 5 hours. So, prepare yourself for a marathon. But it's well worth it and I would highly recommend grabbing a seat at the Kitchen Table."
Le Gavroche,2,4-Feb-24,5,"Up the street from Claridges , on Brook st
Is probably the oldest , since Le Tante Claire - went under, Sadly.
And is still doing well after all these years - is probably the next best authentic French in London.
the brothers ""Roux"" own and operate.

They created BA Concorde menu's in hand with a well known sommelier.
The food and wines were exquisite !"
Le Gavroche,2,29-Sep-22,4,"Overall a very enjoyable meal, though not quite as special as I would have liked for a 2 michelin starred restaurant. We got the Menu Exceptionnel (the tasting menu).

FOOD - 4 stars
- Cheese souffle was somehow decadent yet light. I don't understand how they did it but it was delicious.
- Salmon course had perfectly cooked salmon. The most tender cooked salmon I've ever had. Absolutely delightful.
- The cheese cart was amazing. Incredible selection is all I can really say.
- The other courses were less special though still tasty.

AMBIANCE / SERVICE - 5 stars - About what I'd expect from a 2 michelin starred restaurant. We were a little full at the end of the meal so the staff very kindly served us just the sorbet and packed the rest of the dessert and petit fours into togo boxes for us with detailed instructions on how to best enjoy them the next day.

OVERALL - 4 stars"
Le Gavroche,2,9-Jul-22,5,"No doubt they deserve the accolades. Servers were attentive, professional and discrete. The dining room is a beautiful space. The food and wine list are of legend. We had the soufflé - felt obliged as it is the signature (and we had seen Michel prepare it on 'My Best Dishes'). It was light and sumptuous at the same time - and deliciously complex. My wife had the mushroom ravioli - it wasn't bad, but paled in comparison. Lamb and Veal for the two mains and they were perfectly prepared. Worth the spend. Also visited Gordon Ramsay's namesake in Chelsea during the visit - Le Gavroche was a far better experience for half the cost."
Story,2,25-Nov-22,5,"One of the most fun & tastiest restaurants I've had the pleasure dining in. All the dishes, presentation, music, service were thoughtful.

Highly recommend a stop here. Perfect for date night or a small group dinner."
The Clove Club,2,25-Jun-24,2,"Overall, my experience was mediocre. The ambiance was pleasant, and the service was decent. However, we were seated at a table in the middle of the room, where my chair was frequently bumped by the wait staff and patrons passing by, which was quite annoying and unpleasant. The food was good but not exceptional, particularly considering the price. It was probably one of my most disappointing fine dining experiences in London."
The Clove Club,2,27-May-24,5,"Came here to celebrate a special occasion and let me lead by saying the staff could not have done more to make it so. There was a card greeting us and overall the staff were just such a pleasant group of people. They clearly love the food they're serving and take their job seriously.

The food simply is delicious. The tasting menu comes with so many added on items from the kitchen you aren't expecting. Standouts overall included the Cornish pollock, Cornish crab dumpling, and Middlewhite Pork. The first dessert, the sorbet with yoghurt, was not my favorite. But the Loquat kernel mousse to finish was unreal.

The pricepoint can be a bit scary, as it is pricey. We didn't realize the welcome champagne glasses offered to us for our celebration were not complementary, which was a bummer, and something we would've preferred to know. It certainly was our most expensive restaurant in London by far. Certainly not something we would do on a simple night out, but if you're looking for a full dinner and lovely experience worth considering. The hype is justified for sure."
The Clove Club,2,9-Mar-24,5,"Bottom line first: justified rating as one of the top 50 restaurants of the world--incredible staff, friendly team, and dishes that we will think about for days to come. One of the best meals ever

This was our first big stop in London, after mixed experiences among 3 Michelin-rated places in Paris. Given its reputation as one of the best restaurants in the world, we had very high expectations coming in.

The setting was interesting, in a small but clearly refined space. In the main dining room, there were only a handful of tables, accommodating no greater than 25 people or so. Despite this, there was no formal dress code, as one table had a guy in a T-shirt and jeans, although most were dressed more properly with at least a sweater. The kitchen was entirely open and one with the dining room, and it was awesome seeing various parts of the team interacting pretty seamlessly with each other.

The service was outstanding, and we had at least a small interaction with just about every single member of the staff through the evening. All were very respectful and knowledgeable regarding the dishes. Although just about every dish was excellent, either in taste and/or in presentation, the one that really was outstanding was the trout, which was the first main dish. The maître d' verified that it was the dish that most people kept thinking about afterwards. The use of ingredients were incredible; as examples, how would one expect that:

-potatoes belong on the bottom of an ice cream dessert?
-jalapeño-laced ice would go well with a sorbet?
-almond pieces would complement a fish so well?

The best part for us was that Chef McHale and his team were open to take a small amount of time during the busy service to take a picture with us before we exited. They were generous enough to hear us compliment the team on a wonderful evening, besting the experiences we had at other higher end places such as the French Laundry.

This was clearly one of the best meals we've ever had. As silly as this may sound, the €195 price tag is a bargain and an astronomical value. Although we won't be back anytime soon, if nothing else due to our being located abroad, we will certainly be looking forward to the next time we have an opportunity to enjoy another dinner here."
The Clove Club,2,13-Dec-23,5,"5 out of 5 stars. 100%. A+. I will forever sing praises of my experience here. The restaurant is not pretentious at all. It's so minimalistic and is the epitome of quiet luxury. You might actually walk right past it because it's so understated. As soon as you walk through the door, however, you are treated like a celebrity. You are ushered into a small room with a direct view of the open kitchen. You see the chef, the sous chef and the staff hustling quietly and in an organized fashion. We were seated at the front table and were maybe 3 meters away from the prep station. It was such an intimate dining experience.

The staff were extremely professional. There were more staff than clients to make sure the diners had the best experience.

The food was stellar, both in taste and presentation. The lobster and the pork were my standout favorites of the tasting menu, but to be honest, everything was delicious. It's also not just what's on the tasting menu because the kitchen staff add a few extra little bites in between the courses.

Truly, it was such a special, unique experience and definitely worth it for a special occasion."
The Clove Club,2,5-Jul-23,5,"My wife and I were blown away by the Clove Club. We were visiting London for the first time and wanted to go all out for one meal. We did some research and found a few possible destinations, but we settled on Clove Club since it had great reviews and sources most of the ingredients from in and around the British Isles. Specific highlights of the meal were the smoked trout with almonds and caviar and also the aged pork with artichoke and potatoes but each dish was more delicious than the last, I can't say we had anything that wasn't A or A+ out of about 10-15 courses. The service was exceptional too, they were constantly checking in when needed without feeling overbearing and each member of the staff was friendly and knowledgeable regarding all of the dishes.

There's nothing bad I can say about the meal. Obviously, this was an expensive meal but we knew and expected that going in and it really felt like a special experience that was worth the price of admission."
The Clove Club,2,13-May-23,5,"Absolutely one of the best meals I've had! The service was top notch and the staff was engaging and fun to interact with. In a very interesting part of the city, so arrive early and take a stroll around the neighborhood. This is a must-visit when in London."
The Clove Club,2,24-Jan-23,5,"Great dining experience. Very well paced, all the dishes tasted excellent and were beautifully presented. I was particularly impressed with the sommelier, who recommended a great half bottle ( I was dining alone). Definitely deserves the hype."
The Clove Club,2,22-Jan-23,5,"Best dining experience I've had in my life. I won't go into much detail of each dish we had but it was seafood and game meat heavy. Each plate had the perfect amount of food and each bite was delectable. The scallop, black truffle, and mushroom dish was jaw dropping, one of the best plates I've ever had. The venison dish showcased different cuts and was a close second to the scallop.

The service was lovely, you will be seved by atleast 6 people who will provide you detail of each dish and make sure you are enjoying the meal. The meal ended up being £585 and that included the tasting menu and 3 drinks each for two people. You definitely get what you pay for here. Must visit."
The Clove Club,2,2-Jan-23,5,"A truly excellent meal, both the food and service were outstanding and there was only one real hiccup during our lunch which was fine.

The space is nice, bright and open, you don't feel overwhelmed even though it's not a huge dining room. The pacing of the meal is great, the food is awesome, servers are not overbearing but very timely for removing dishes or refilling waters/getting drinks.

The food is very well executed and interesting/unique. Some very fun flavor combinations and use of ingredients, good sauces and very memorable bites. This was my second favorite meal in a week-long euro trip consisting of 15 michelin stars.
"
The Clove Club,2,20-Dec-22,5,"Our second time to the Clove Club, the verdict is we love it more than our last visit (which was a cocktail pairing menu) at the bar.

We started with amazing cocktails. They are just so refreshing and well balanced.

We liked the first couple of small bites; Buttermilk fried chicken came with pine needle salt and presented on pine needles. This was nicely cooked, and it is easy to like fried chicken but might need a bit more seasoning.

The first course was the raw hand-dived Orkney scallop came on a bed of dashi gel made using the scallop coral, shavings of chestnut mushrooms, a little clementine and truffle. The scallop had good inherent sweetness and was nicely balanced by the acidity of the clementine. This was a pleasing minimalist dish that allowed the main ingredient to really shine.

The cod was next, resting on a bed of celeriac and potato puree, with very crispy skin.

The meat dish was the deer cooked perfectly medium rare.

There was an unusual pre-dessert in the form of grilled habanero chilli granita with plum sorbet and sheep milk yoghurt mousse. I am a big chilli fan and this was certainly interesting.

The main dessert was the interesting masked potato purée with a salted caramel ice cream, which was heavenly. Wow, blown away.

Service was very good, and the sommelier was friendly and knowledgeable. The bill came to £275 per person in total. 2 Michelin stars, Top 50 best restaurant fame, Clove Club is worth it."
The Clove Club,2,2-Dec-22,5,"The double edged sword of being a reasonably confident, relatively creative cook is that often when I eat out I think to myself, ""I could make this."" At no point during yesterday's lunch at The Clove Club did that thought even enter my mind. Each course was inventive, delicious, innovative, and perfectly executed. The service was exceptional. The milieu was perfection. Since it was my one and only splurge meal while here in London, it was under a lot of pressure to perform, and it did so beautifully. Definitely fine dining at its highest level."
The Clove Club,2,13-Oct-22,5,"I will not go into too much detail about the various dishes since it changes. Overall this is one of the best if not the best meal I have had in London.

Service was lovely - all the staff were friendly and attentive, and it wasn't strange to dine here alone (at least for me). I got the wine and tea mixed pairing and sat at the bar. The tea pairing was interesting especially and I also loved the wine choices.

Every dish was complex in flavors and textures, and each bite was a discovery. As a broth/soup lover, one of the earlier dishes was a green soup that tasted refreshing. I also loved the tongue ""taco,"" and the scallop and lobster dishes were perfectly cooked. I got the add on which combined broth with a 1968 madeira, which is the 2nd oldest madeira and 3rd oldest wine I've had. This was a fascinating combo, as you get the umami and savoriness from the broth and a lovely fragrance from the madeira. The dessert was excellent too.
"
The Clove Club,2,25-Jul-22,5,"The finest restaurant experience you could ever imagine. Run don't walk to get a reservation.
I'd fly back to London just to eat there again"
The Clove Club,2,14-Jul-22,5,"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a world class experience. As a Michelin 2 star, I definitely had super high expectations. Made a reservation within the week and was surprised that I was able to get a seat at the bar. Upon arrival, the hostess offered to upsell me into the main dining room where I could get a view of the open kitchen.

The restaurant is in a dated building. There was an air conditioner in the main dining room although it was only somewhat cool. Most of the staff were dressed nicely...

The attire of diners varied from t-shirt, jeans, and trainers to a table dressed in a full suit with tie. Numerous diners and staff alike were donning Swiss watches.

There were 2 menu options in the dining room, full tasting or short tasting with a couple less courses. Opted for the full tasting menu and it was a 3 hour experience.

Meal started off with a few snacks which were fantastic. Excellent cooking with contrasting flavors and textures.

Service by the front of the house staff was consistent with new silverware for each course. The demeanor of the front of the house staff was also proper and delicate.

The loo was definitely dated, in line with the building. The stairwell to the lower level loos were also tight. Faucets were split into hot and hold. The positioning of the faucet was very close to the edge of the basin too...

Highlights from the evening's tasting menu included the Aubergine and Lobster, all cooked to world class standards. The dry aged pork was a slight disappointment as it was on the blander side, despite being cooked to a medium well with a slight pink inside.

Right before the dessert course, the staff suggested a potato dessert add-on for an additional £25. To my surprise, it was a potato dessert with an ice cream topped with generous truffles.

The advertised menu price is before 20% VAT, a ~13% service charge, a £2 cooking for Ukraine and a £1.5 fee for still water.

£270/head after VAT, service, drinks, and fees."
The Clove Club,2,28-Jun-22,3,"This was our first meal after taking the Eurostar from Paris to London and we had a lunch reservation at the posh 2 Michelin starred and 2021 top 50 restaurant The Clove Club in Shoreditch. What a wonderful vintage and clean decor. The wait staff was friendly and attentive. The food was tasty and adequately portioned. No overfeeding here, though.

We were put off and honestly disgusted by the sous chef, or quality control chef, who repeatedly tasted the sauces with the same spoon that he appeared to put in the pan of sauce/food to be served to guest. He and other members of the cook staff repeatedly rubbed their noses multiple times without any evidence of hand washing or sanitizing before touching food to be plated for consumption. It was so visible for patrons to see with an open kitchen that we were tempted to leave and contact department of health officials.

For this reason, I cannot recommend this dining establishment until they literally ""clean up their act."""
Gymkhana,1,11-Jul-24,5,"Would give Gymkhana six stars if I could. Was lucky enough to grab a table when bookings for the week I was in London opened. This was one of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had.

First, the food. Unlike many fine dining restaurants, they feed you. Generous portions of hands down the best Indian food I've ever had (and I've had a lot). The butter chicken, pappadums, and Goan prawn curry were all outstanding. The smell of the naan was just absolutely heavenly.

The service was as good if not better. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and saved us from over ordering (see above re portion size). He said we'd just have to come back to try the rest of the amazing food on the menu.

The only thing that would keep me from going back is being unable to find a table because it's so (rightly) popular. But if I can get a table, I'm going back every chance I can."
Gymkhana,1,5-Jul-24,3,We had drinks at 42 the Gymhkana cocktail lounge. Good drinks and nice ambiance. But absolutely no food available. Not even a chip. This should be clear on the website.
Gymkhana,1,28-Jun-24,5,"Had a great dinner at Gymkhana - we got the pappadum, samosas, butter chicken, briyani and garlic naan. The highlight of the meal was definitely the briyani! Everything was delicious and the service was amazing. The food was quite pricy however, but we knew that going in, especially since it is a 2 MIchelin star restaurant."
Gymkhana,1,15-Jun-24,4,"Review is for Bar 42 only - the sister bar connected to Gymkhana - leaving here because yelp doesn't have anything for Bar 42.

5 stars for cocktails alone, giving 4 because the snack options were sparse and quite disappointing for being part of such a highly praised restaurant.

Anyway, come here for the cocktails! This is by far the best lychee martini I've ever had - Nobu no longer holds the top spot. Wow. So clean and fresh and not syrupy sweet. I had 4. Whoops.

All of the drinks on the menu looked incredible and I'd love to branch out and try some of their other cocktails. I'm sure they're all good.

For the food, they really don't offer much which is a bummer seeing as they are part of gymkhana. For the table we ordered:
The nuts (cashews & almonds that tasted like they had Trader Joe's everything but the bagel seasonings); the kalamata olives (it seemed people liked these, and they were flavorful, I'm just not a big olive gal); the chips/crisps and yogurt dip (crisps were light and airy and tossed in aromatic seasoning powder, the yogurt was just plain yogurt with chives). You've gotta order them because it's all they offer but I want impressed and think they can do better. Out of the three I chose the chips and dip."
Gymkhana,1,10-Jun-24,1,"Such a miserable experience! After making a res 4 weeks in advance they would not let our 15 1/2 yo in the restaurant and turned us away (in the very fine print). Such arrogance and pretension. If you place any value on family, I would pass and spend $$$ on a place with any heart and value for the patron experience. What a disaster."
Gymkhana,1,30-May-24,5,"We really enjoyed dining at Gymkhana and thought the food was amazing! The service was prompt, the servers were all very friendly and made us feel at home and did not miss a beat throughout the entire meal. The ambiance was cozy so we felt at home and we could enjoy each other's company and talk at a normal level. The food was AMAZING - very flavorful and loved the different bites throughout the meal. We definitely will be back and will highly recommend this place to anyone visiting London."
Gymkhana,1,28-May-24,5,"Had heard so much about this place that I decided to venture solo without a booking this rainy wet Tuesday morning. The hostess was absolutely fantastic and welcoming and gave me a table on the condition that I return it in 90 minutes - not a problem for me at all!!

The servers were very knowledgeable and warm and quick with an explanation of the menu and dishes. I ordered two starters, nimbu pani, mango lassi and masala chai. Wiped the plates clean. Amazing taste. Left feeling fulfilled.

It's not often that a much hyped up place lives upto its high expectations - luckily today was once such day overall. Great ambiance resembling ""Gymkhana's from the yesteryears. Loved every minute.

Thanks Gymkhana team."
Gymkhana,1,18-May-24,5,"We had an amazing experience at gymkhana . The food was was delicious . The service was excellent. The place is beautifully decorated and the seating is very nice . Loyd took care of us with utmost care and was extremely attentive and provided helpful tips about the food and portions. His personal touch stood out the most to me. All the staff we came in contact with were genuine and very nice . The aloo chat , the chutney accompaniment to the papadams were very tasty. The chicken tikka and salmon were also super tasty. As for the Naan , I thought it was bit on the harder side but still flavorful."
Gymkhana,1,14-May-24,5,"Amazing food and great service. We tried the tiger prawns, the butter chicken, the saag veggie, the rack of lamb, and course a side of garlic naan. Amazing cocktails and then head upstairs to 42 for a night cap."
Gymkhana,1,8-May-24,5,"The food and service was simply outstanding. 6 stars all round. Incredible menu , each dish was exceptional. Thank You."
Gymkhana,1,6-May-24,4,"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a decent experience. Made a reservation online and my table was ready upon arrival. Gymkhana is a Michelin 2 star Indian restaurant in London and features indoor dining exclusively on the street level or in the basement.

Portions at Gymkhana are gigantic. Opted for the £115 tasting menu and it was probably enough food for 2-3 diners... Definitely save room to try out other courses and don't indulge all at once!

Gymkhana gives off old money vibes with a surprising number of tourists.

Started off with the Pappadum Selection, Shrimp Sorpotel & Nimbu Achari Raita, Gol Guppas, Jaljeera, Potato, Sprouting Moong. The pappadum selection was gigantic and sufficient for 2-3 diners. The Gol Guppa was unique.

Moved on to the Amritsari Pink Shrimps & Queenies, Dill Raita which I found mediocre. Flavors were vibrant although I didn't find the shrimps too fresh. The presentation was also a touch lacklustre for a Michelin 2 star.

The Gilafi Quail Seekh Kebab, Mint & Mustard Chutney may have been the highlight of the meal being super flavorful, fragrant, and juicy. The kebab did have a slight kick to it. Perhaps a side of bread/rice would have been nice with this course.

The Goan Prawn Curry consisted of 3 prawns. The curry was flavorful and this course came with Dal Maharani, Saag Makai, and a Bread Basket. The prawn curry was the correct size and the remainder of the dishes were also perfect for 2-3 diners.. I've had better naan at Dishoom.

Meal ended off with a gigantic Cardamom & Basmati Rice Kheer, Fresh Mango, Sorbet along with some petit fours. The rice kheer was flavorful although I merely was able to make a dent in this gigantic dessert.

There was an optional £1 generic donation added to the bill which I had the waitstaff help remove..."
Gymkhana,1,2-May-24,5,Excellent food. First class service. And great ambiance. Possibly the finest Indian food outside India.
Gymkhana,1,8-Apr-24,5,"Believe the hype. This is probably the best Indian food west of the subcontinent.

The tasting menu was a perfect meal from start to finish. The tandoori broccoli and kid goat keema Lai were highlights from the early courses. Be aware, though, that it's a ton of food, so come hungry. The final savory course includes not just the entree you choose (the butter chicken is a must) but also two kinds of rice, a bread basket with naan, saag, daal makhni, and a raita. It was one of the best meals I've ever had but we were totally stuffed by the end."
Gymkhana,1,5-Apr-24,5,"Food was delicious and drinks were interesting and tasty.
Service was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly.
Atmosphere and decor is top notch."
Gymkhana,1,16-Jan-24,4,"Food: ordered the aloo chaat, tandoori masala lamb chops, chicken butter masala, and the dal maharani. The chaat and the dal were both standouts, with amazing flavor and immediate comfort. The lamb chops were also good, but a few of the pieces were a bit overdone. The chicken butter masala was a heightened version of your typical butter chicken, with more complex and layered flavors and spices. For dessert, we had a selection of sorbets (coconut & lime, mango) and ice cream (South Indian filter coffee), which were incredibly refreshing.

The staff are friendly and knowledgeable, explaining the dishes and recommending which selections would complement each other.

Highly recommend a meal here."
Gymkhana,1,29-Dec-23,2,"This place used to be good. Honestly it used to be one of the best Indian restaurants in London. But when I tell you it has fallen off a cliff I am not exaggerating. The food was barely recognizable. We got the tasting menu and in addition to the service being slow and the waiters seeming like we were in their way, the food...oh my god I was so disappointed. The naan was burnt and the black daal that we look forward to so much tasted bland and unseasoned. Save yourself a bad evening and go to Dishoom. Much better food and service."
Gymkhana,1,21-Dec-23,5,"If I had to recommend one restaurant in London, it would be Gymkhana. Now this is my first Michelin star restaurant and the experience absolutely won me over. Starting with drinks, I went with something virgin: the Mango Ginger spritz and it was SO good I had to order it twice.

My boyfriend went with the Muntjac Biryani, a game meat which happens to be a cute little miniature deer that is an invasive species haha. I couldn't, I was a Vegetarian for years before we met and I still 70% am. I went with the vegetarian tasting menu. The waiter and chef was so kind to include two servings complimentary (as per the regular one) so that my boyfriend was included in my tastings as well as a vegetarian biryani for me, so I could try his biryani. We didn't request this. They went above and beyond!

My favorite dish was the paneer on the tasting menu. It was so creamy and delicious. Absolutely blew my mind!

10/10 would recommend and you must get the tasting menu! Come hungry!"
Gymkhana,1,26-Nov-23,5,"If your not a fan, you'll be a fan. It's absolutely worth going and returning. Service, presentation, taste and texture is absolutely amazing!"
Gymkhana,1,17-Nov-23,5,Authentic Indian cuisine rivaling the traditional Indian cuisine. Ambiance and service are excellent as well.
Gymkhana,1,15-Nov-23,5,Abdul was the most knowledgeable person regarding everything we had and more. He is such a delight it was great getting to know his story on coming to the UK and it's even better knowing Gymkhana helps students.
Gymkhana,1,8-Nov-23,5,The food is absolutely amazing here! Service and all staff was excellent. Definitely highly recommend this restaurant to anyone once visiting London. It needs to be on your list of must try. Will visit again for sure!
Gymkhana,1,1-Nov-23,5,"Delicious food, great drinks, beautiful design. We were welcomed straight away. All staff were friendly and the food was delicious."
Gymkhana,1,30-Oct-23,5,"We had a fantastic time at Gymkhana celebrating our anniversary and my husband's birthday. This is five star service and food without being Uber pretentious.

Our favorite dishes included the Kid Goat Methi Keema, Chicken Butter Masala and the Pork Cheek Vindaloo.

We also tried the Punjabi Samosas and Kasoori Chicken Tikka. They were also very good, but not as stand out as the top dishes.

All in all - service, vibes, food and drinks were excellent. You really can't beat the price for a Michelin star meal either."
Gymkhana,1,21-Oct-23,5,"It's not every day you get to dine at a Michelin-starred restaurant let alone a Michelin-starred Indian restaurant, but in London you can do this! I elected to get lunch at Gymkhana because a) it worked for my schedule and b) they have a really great lunch menu that is considerably affordable by Michelin standards. For £44 I got a delicious multi-course meal that I sadly couldn't finish. It was so much food and I wish my hotel had a fridge/microwave as I would have wanted to take the rest with me.

Lunch starts with a pappadum selection including 4 different kinds of crisps: potato and chili, lentil, rice, and wheat and fenugreek. It also has 3 different dips/spreads including a lemon pickle and yogurt raita, coriander and mint chutney, and shrimp sorpotel which is made with dried shrimp and tomato. Each of the pappadums was really delicious as were all of the spreads. I ate way to much of this LOL.

You also get a generous portion of aloo chaat which was SO GOOD and I also ate way too much of it before the rest of my meal arrived.

You get to select an appetizer, and I got the Goan cafreal salmon tikka with tomato chutney. It really a totally new dish for me and a really unique experience. I really loved it. The salmon was so tender and juicy and practically melted in my mouth. The tomato chutney was spicier than I expected but a really nice complement to the fish.

For my main course I chose the chicken butter masala, which is perhaps the least adventurous option but a perennial favorite and one I couldn't resist. It came with dal lasooni, saag makai (saag corn), and either basmati rice or a bread basket.

OMG everything was so phenomenal I can't even express in words. I was impressed by each dish and immediately made note to try and recreate some of them myself at home.

Aside from the incredible food, the ambiance is really warm yet sophisticated. I love the decor. The service was fantastic. Not only was my server on point, but the hostess and I am guessing one of the managers who was up by the hostess stand were very friendly and chatted with me after my meal and asked me where I was from and talked about my meal and other plans in London.

Even the bartender was extremely friendly and vocal even though I was only walking by the bar to head to the bathroom. I felt truly welcome and never felt like it was a stuffy or stuck-up kind of place.

If you love Indian food, you absolutely must put Gymkhana on your list for restaurants to try in London. You won't be disappointed."
Gymkhana,1,30-Sep-23,3,"The food was good here, however the service was not what I would expect from a Michelin star restaurant. The waitstaff seemed to go out of their way to make us feel like we didn't belong there. It was disappointing."
Gymkhana,1,13-Sep-23,4,"Indian food is necessary for me wherever I travel and Gymkhana more than delivered on quality, ambiance, service and taste. Blown away. Highly recommend going with some friends and family styling it to try more or going at times when you can do the tasting menu! Be aware that you should make reservations ahead of time as they fill up very+E262 quick!"
Gymkhana,1,31-Aug-23,4,The food was excellent. Very tasty. Is my favorite Indian restaurant. Great decor and unbelievable atmosphere. It's a little pricey but is worth it. Service was excellent. Very clean. Definitely I will go back.
Gymkhana,1,28-Aug-23,1,"Cannot review the food as we were turned away from our reservation after a 20 pound cab ride to get there. Greeted by two very uppity hostesses who informed us very smugly that our reservation was at their sister restaurant (although we made our reservation at this location on line). We were told it was a 10 minute walk from this location to their sister restaurant, Brigadiers. They said they would call Brigadiers to let them know we would be late for our reservation. They did not. A ""10 minute walk"" was a 58 min walk or a 20 minute cab ride... (another 20 pounds), which we had to take to get there in time. They may have a 1 star Michelin rating but who wants to eat their with the hostess' snooty attitude? We just wanted a great Indian meal and they actually laughed at us!!"
Gymkhana,1,21-Aug-23,5,"Loved this restaurant!!! My mom and I flew in from the US and were really excited to try this restaurant on our trip to London. Our flight got cancelled and we were so sad we missed our reservation but the restaurant staff was beyond helpful and understanding and were able to squeeze us in later that night. We are so thankful they did!!!! The whole experience was phenomenal. The restaurant itself was so authentic and neat, the staff was very helpful and kind, and the food was amazing!!! We had great drinks, great food, and an excellent tine. I can't wait to go back. The food was also perfect for splitting meals and trying multiple things so I felt we got a good taste of a lot of items on the menu- all delicious!!"
Gymkhana,1,17-Aug-23,5,"Indian food is necessary for me wherever I travel and Gymkhana more than delivered on quality, ambiance, service and taste. Blown away. Highly recommend going with some friends and family styling it to try more or going at times when you can do the tasting menu! Be aware that you should make reservations ahead of time as they fill up very quick!"
Gymkhana,1,11-Aug-23,5,"Unbelievable experience!!! Excellent food, incredible service, delicious drinks, cool atmosphere! Upstairs is buzzing and a cool, fun vibe and the downstairs is swanky and sexier vibe for a date or small group. You MUST get a reservation in advance or you won't get in bc it's small and limited seating. It may be pricey to some but I think it's worth every penny! You'll be craving Indian food long after you leave! Everything my waiter suggested is what we ordered and we loved every single bite! Do what you can to try this spot out! They plan to open locations in the USA in a couple of years--one in NYC and another in Miami!"
Gymkhana,1,10-Jul-23,5,"The food, service and ambiance were all exceptional. Totally enjoyed the experience at gymkhana.

The aloo chat, samosa and paneer tikka were flavorful and all the main course items were also delicious."
Gymkhana,1,8-Jul-23,5,"Love the ambience, the service is great and the food has a wide variety and great flavor !
Highly recommend Gymkhana if you are traveling to London, just be sure to make a reservation well in advance."
Gymkhana,1,7-Jul-23,5,"Fantastic Indian fare with more than reasonable prices, and well paired gin cocktails that enhance the meal itself. The butter chicken and vindaloo were shared by my wife and I, and neither were anything less than stunning. A must return to for us the next time we cross the pond."
Gymkhana,1,19-Jun-23,3,"I hesitated whether to write a review or not because my mediocre review is so specific to my personal experience, but here I am anyways. I went to a dinner here last month with a group of 8. Because of the size of our party we were required to dine from the ""vault menu"". I have a mango allergy but in looking at the vault menu it didn't seem like it would be much of a problem. When we were seated at our table I let our server know about my allergy, all good. Well when the food started coming out it turned out that lots (almost all) of the dishes had mango in them even if it wasn't listed as an ingredient on the menu. I guess they marinate a lot of the meats in some kind of mango sauce? I'm not sure, but by the time I was able to eat anything I was well and truly drunk. About halfway through the meal they had to start bringing dishes that were specifically for me that didn't have the mango in them. Everyone else in the group looooooved dinner, and the dishes that I did get to try were very good. I would just go ahead and pick somewhere else for dinner if you have a mango allergy and call it a day!"
Gymkhana,1,11-Jun-23,2,"DON'T GO HERE IF YOU HAVE A DISABILITY: The food and table service was excellent, but I was disturbed that the host staff kept me from using the only disabled accessible bathroom on the ground floor. In fact, the staff seemed adamant about forcing me to go downstairs to the basement to use the men's toilet, even after I directed their attention to the fact that I am an above the knee amputee and wear prosthetic limbs. UK law is such that disabled customers can use an opposite gender restroom if it is the only disabled accessible one. When I climbed back up the stairs from the men's toilet in the basement, the same hostess seemed oddly pleased with her decision. Later that evening, I watched someone arrive in a wheelchair and the same host staff told this person that they would be seated downstairs, which was also something I've never seen in a restaurant before."
Gymkhana,1,29-May-23,5,"The best Indian food you'll ever eat in your life. Service is excellent, wine list is excellent. The restaurant has a nice warm and welcoming vibe. We were a party of 8 so we sat in the vault room and had the lamb feast. It was one of the most memorable dining experiences of my lifetime. The sommelier was a sweet and delightful Italian. Everything was wonderful. It's no wonder this restaurant has held a Michelin star for a decade.

Go and splurge. You'll be so glad you did. And you'll wish you were back again tomorrow."
Gymkhana,1,2-May-23,5,"Delicious Indian food, excellent service and unique and comfortable surroundings. Really enjoyed our visit."
Gymkhana,1,17-Apr-23,5,"If I could give this 10 stars, I would. Food was out of this world. But what made it great was the service. Thank you Izzy, our server, who patiently explained all the dishes to us, made us laugh and took great care of us; and Connor, our sommelier, who made a point of suggesting wine pairings that we might never would have chosen on our own. One of us ordered the dinner tasting menu, it was sufficient for our party of three to sample virtually everything. Courses appeared seamlessly. All around, it was a memorable experience. Highly recommended!"
Gymkhana,1,8-Apr-23,5,Excellent on all grounds.Our waiter Lo(?) guided us thru the menu to our pleasure.Food was delicious.Servicing was first class.Thank you for our wonderful evening and please keep on with your business.
Gymkhana,1,6-Apr-23,5,"Ambiance in the downstairs bar was awesome, we sat with Alex the bartender who was courteous and a great host. The food and drinks were top notch, absolutely the best Indian food I've ever had. Overall, my favorite meal in London so far. Definitely recommend"
Gymkhana,1,2-Apr-23,5,Some of the most delicious food I have ever eaten in my life. Beautiful restaurant. Wonderful experience. Can't wait to return next time I'm in London.
Gymkhana,1,30-Mar-23,5,"Amazing service and food! Highly recommend if you are looking for authentic Indian dishes in London this is a must. Chicken tikka, duck egg appetizer, and kid goat !"
Gymkhana,1,8-Mar-23,1,"The staff at the Donovan Bar at the Brown's Hotel recommended Gymkhana to us. I was excited as I didn't realize that Gymkhana was just down the street. I have been killing it with Gymkhana's chicken butter masala recipe from The Guardian and wanted to try the original!!!

It was early evening (5:00) on a Tuesday in March. The hostess at the front of the house informed us that they were booked for the evening. Upon inquiring about a table anytime that week for lunch or dinner we were informed, rather rudely, that they were ""very busy and booked for the next three months"". We were very disappointed...

Upon returning to our room, I cruised Gymkhana's website and saw that tables were available for lunch and dinner that week. I was so annoyed that I didn't bother to book one and doubt that I ever will."
Gymkhana,1,18-Feb-23,5,"I had been waiting to come here for my next trip to London. I was not disappointed. We decide do the Feast downstairs in the private room. Easily it fit 6 and had room for 2-3 more. Food was outstanding and the service. We had a mixture of the meat and the vegetarian feast. Spice level was superb as well. The prawns were fantastic. Do not miss out on the wine, they have any amazing Schist Chenin Blanc which paired perfect."
Gymkhana,1,22-Jan-23,5,"Gymkhana has the best Indian food I've had in my entire life. We did the fixed course menu to get a taste of a bunch of different plates, so much food. The biryani, butter chicken, and saag was mouthwatering.

Was way more food than a usual prix fixe menu, we ended up taking some to go. The service was attentive and the space was so chic. Definitely worth the splurge and is one of the better Michelin star places I've been to.
"
Gymkhana,1,10-Jan-23,5,"After trying Indian food all over the world, and all over london as well Gymkhana has blown me away. Easily one of the top 3 restaurants I have ever been to in my life. The inside decor is absolutely beautiful. The service was absolutely incredible. The food was amazing! Very spicy if you ask for it spicy, which I absolutely loved. The lamb chops were so tender and juicy some of the best I've ever had. The chicken tikka masala and daal were incredible. We also got kebabs, pani puri and a lamb shank type dish. The naans were super buttery, garlicky and crispy. I absolutely loved this entire experience. I hope one day they bring this to New York as well."
Gymkhana,1,5-Jan-23,5,"This was the best place I ate at in London. Hands down. I browse the Michelin Guide, and it has a lot of good restaurants, but let's face it, the large majority of it are the same stuff, or Japanese. But I digress. I see this foreign city, I see Indian food, I see 1 Michelin Star, and I go full steam ahead.

The restaurant itself is beautiful. It feels like you're walking into like a 70's disco club. Amber lighting, warm wood everywhere, including on the wall, red vinyl booths, it was just very nice. Felt like I was in a movie. We got lead to our table in the downstairs area, which was really cool.

The main reason I chose this place was because it offers a tasting menu, with options for each of the courses. That way you can show up with someone and try to many things. I think the menu changes periodically, so I will just post the menu I had that night, and go over the highlights, because I don't want to waste your time with every single thing I ate.

Pappadum Selection, Shrimp Sorptel & Nimbu Achari Raita. This was the super fun appetizer course. We didn't get an option here. We just got this, and thank goodness, because it was a good intro of sauces and flavors and textures and it introduces the idea of the interactive nature of Indian cuisine. A lot of fun, and very delicious.

Aloo Chaat, Tamarind, Sev. This was amazing. I got introduced to chaat here, which is like a whole new course of food options that's apparently big in India. And wow. Now I'm obsessed. So flavorful and crunchy and fun. AND it got topped with sev, which is another new favorite thing of mine. It was like eating a bowl of delicious, fuzzy, crispy love. Get this.

Kid Goat Methi Keema, Salli, Pao. Another fun one! Imagine like goat sloppy joe with two slider rolls there, so you can make your own little sandwiches or open-face sandwiches. Then there's some onion and a pepper so you can customize your flavors. Delicious. I love goat. Get this.

Wild Muntjac, Biryani, Pomegranate & Mint Raita. The Main Event! If you haven't had biryani before, you NEED to. It's like Indian fried rice, but a million times better, not kidding. Very saffron-y. And it was served inside of a puff pastry that they cut open for you right at tableside and expose you to a huge whiff of love. And, it was my first time trying muntjac, which is delicious. Unfortunately cute, but delicious.

Saffron Pistachio Kulfi Falooda. Dessert! I love exploring deeper into new cuisines, because you see things you've never seen before. And this is a new dessert that I've never seen before! It was wild! It was sweet, and fruity, and yogurt-like, and jelly-like, and texturally varied. It was fresh and delicious and beautiful and fun.

Overall, this was a wild night for me. I encountered new things, and my world was opened up a little bit more. If you are visiting London, or if you live in London, you NEED to come here.

"
Amaya,1,11-Jul-24,4,So happy to have stumbled upon this gem of a place. We got the platter where we could try all their highlights on the lunch menu and it was amazing. My favorite bite was the fish and we also ordered the biriyani additional which was also a standout. Everything on that platter was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place and the drinks and service were all fantastic. The ambience is nice but isn't necessarily standout and it was quite empty during lunch when we went but didn't take away from the experience. And maybe this place deserves more hype! Oh and the drinks were also fab!
Amaya,1,3-Jul-24,5,I have been going to Amaya for years for good reason. The food is excellent as is the service. While it's mainly Indian staples they do introduce some orthogonal dishes as part of their tasting menu. It is impressive that they have maintained this consistency over all these years.
Amaya,1,30-Jun-24,5,"Amaya has been around for a long time and competes against many excellent Indian restaurants in London but the service and food remain exceptional. The tasting menu continues to evolve keeping a mix of tandoori, rice and naan dishes with more modern appetizers, desserts and seafood dishes. The cocktails are refreshing and well matched to the menu. The price is pretty good considering it's a Michelin one star and the cost of the tasting menu without wine is very near what you would pay for high tea. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Only word of caution is that it's hot in the summer. Dress appropriately"
Amaya,1,16-Jun-24,5,I loved everything about Amaya! The food was delicious with beautiful presentation. The drinks were creative and the service was superb! The ambiance was unique and you see the warm welcome smiles from the front staff once you arrived at the door! Amaya is the restaurant where I would go if I only had time for one meal in London. Thank you Amaya!
Amaya,1,26-May-24,5,"Exceptional all around--first class place! Each part of the meal was meticulously prepared and beautifully presented. The chili paneer was a sneaky good surprise, the oyster ""early"" selection was magnificent, the Tandoori duck was fab (as was the kebab) and the roghan josh was sublime, followed by a great mango plus ice cream dessert. Terrific!"
Amaya,1,6-May-24,5,Perfect meal every time! I am already looking forwards to my next trip to London and Amaya.
Amaya,1,17-Apr-24,5,"Food, drinks, service and ambia always topform. one of our most favorite London restaurants."
Amaya,1,1-Apr-24,5,"Truly an incredible dining experience! Amaya's Michelin star is well deserved! You absolutely must try the Black Pepper Chicken Tikka, the King Scallops, the Goat's Cheese & Yogurt Kebab, and the Chicken Curry. This might be my top restaurant ever! If you love Indian food, you simply must try!"
Amaya,1,4-Nov-23,5,"Definitely deserving of the star! Exquisite. Be prepared. It is not your typical Indian restaurant , so don't come expecting your regular Butter chicken. Tyson curated our experience, describing each dish in detail.
Well worth it"
Amaya,1,14-Oct-23,1,"Food and service were excellent.
Portion size was the smallest I've ever had and far to expensive. 5 people came out to over 1,000 GBP!
Not worthy of a Michelin rating, not enough, not worth it in any way.

The worst part was the table of unruly, loud and disgusting patrons behind us. No manners! Wild animals act better! At one point the man at the table of his WIVES and children spit on the floor next to my family member who was wearing a dress. He thought she shouldn't wear such revealing clothing outside and cursed at the whole table telling us we are heathens and that women shouldn't be seen and that our men should punish us women. Welcome to the 21st century London.
If men from other places can't deal with women wearing and saying what they want they shouldn't dine out in London!


Disgusting behavior and the restaurant did nothing."
Amaya,1,3-Jul-23,5,Power food and service. Consistently good year after year. We will be back next trip. Great location and quiet.
Amaya,1,25-Jun-23,5,"The most amazing Indian food served Tapas style. For a group of 4, plan on at least 6 dishes and don't be afraid to experiment. The vegetarian foods are outstanding. M favorite is the lamb chops and the sea bass. Go For It!!"
Amaya,1,16-Jun-23,5,"Flavor was exceptional, service was flawless and the vibe in restaurant was magical. We can't wait to return."
Amaya,1,10-May-23,5,"The welcome at the door was friendly. When we were sat at our table, the attention given to us by our waiter was amazing; timely and not intrusive. He asked us if we'd been there before (which we hadn't) and then gave us a briefing in the restaurant and the menu. We went for the non-vegetarian menu and we're really impressed with all the dishes. As each course was presented to us, we were given an explanation of what was in the table. That helped as you tend to forget what is in a tasting menu! All the dishes tasted so good. We will definitely be coming back here again."
Amaya,1,28-Apr-23,2,"Nothing about this restaurant is Michelin.
Nope. Sorry. Nada.
Good enough food.
But nothing worth the $ or hype."
Benares,1,16-Jun-24,5,"Absolutely the best Indian food I have ever had the pleasure of having! Everything was superb, from the moment we walked through the door! The attention to detail was first class and well deserving of their Michelin rating if they still have one. The wine list is excellent and the food was unbelievably fantastic! The baked Malabar scallop was out of this world good! I seriously can't imagine tasting anything quite so amazing! We also had the Samosa Ragda and again, a beautiful preparation and explosion of taste. We had a number of entries including the lamb chops with seasoned basmati rice, which was unbelievable! The butter chicken was exquisite as was the Palak Paneer and the Dal Makhani! For desert we had the Madagascan Vanilla Rasmalai Strawberry, the Panna Cotta and the Gulab Jamun. All were incredible! This was truly an extraordinary dining experience!"
Benares,1,28-Mar-24,1,"Was really looking forward to this dinner. Ordered the chicken starter, which is ground chicken in balls. Bit into something very hard. The waiter came over and saw me looking at it. He brought it to the chef. The chef said it was cartilage that shouldn't have been in the dish. Disgusting! BTW, I was still charged for the dish even though their chef admitted it was a mistake. Shocked. I won't be back despite enjoying a few of the other dishes. Just felt wrong and gross."
Benares,1,11-Oct-23,1,"I walked in and asked for a table for one, on the recommendation of a friend. They told me they were fully booked for the evening. Ten minutes later I was able to book a table for two at any time I wanted on OpenTable. Liars."
Benares,1,28-Feb-23,5,"Amazing food around the park. Lamp chops are some
Of the best I've ever had. Solid option if gym khana is too busy."
Benares,1,28-Dec-22,3,"For a one star Michelin restaurant, this place really underwhelmed. The food was mediocre and the service was friendly but abysmally slow. They forgot our drinks twice and we cancelled one of the orders because it didn't come during dinner."
Benares,1,13-Nov-22,2,"We entered Benares with extremely high expectations: it is the first restaurant on our honeymoon, we were tremendously tired after being awake for 30 hours, and it is an Indian restaurant with a Michelen star which at least in the states, is a rare thing.

We were taken to our table and note that at this point there was nothing overly different between this restaurant and the ones we have been to in other countries. The service started right away and was in poor order. It was unclear who was waiting on us and who was assisting. Within five minutes of seating, before a drink order, we were asked to place our whole order in. We told them we needed more time every five minutes. After a reminder we weren't offered drinks, our drink order was taken.

First look at the tasting menu, I couldn't help but feel unimpressed with the options. Meat not usual to Indian cuisine was listed and poorly described. We instead ordered a la Carte which options were quite few. The lamb while well presented was over cooked. The chicken Tikka was good but not in anyway refined. The Naan was inconsistent with some spots extremely chewy whereas other parts crispy. Only one dessert option without nuts.

The experience was lack luster and I am at loss at how this restaurant got a Michelin star after considering the poor service alone. Would consider other dining options in the future."
Benares,1,17-Jul-22,5,Here's a shout out to the wonderful staff (all from Goa!). I have a picky daughter and they bent over backwards to get her the perfect butter chicken with naan. The three course meal - with the alfonso cheesecake at the end - is divine! Thank you.
Benares,1,11-Jun-22,5,"Had a great experience at Benares. Their veggie options are limited but the quality was awesome.
Rasmalai was out of the world."
Benares,1,13-May-22,5,"Highly recommend this delightful restaurant to dine! Had scallops,ceviche, lobster pulao, halibut, palak paneer and dal tadka all superb. An excellent wine to pair with the skillfully spiced dishes. Polite and professional service."
Benares,1,16-Feb-22,1,"Incredibly rude service - don't get me wrong food was absolutely amazing but as a Michelin this should definitely be an all encompassing experience.

When I was called to remind my reservation, the hostess on the other end was very to the point and more of a ""DONT FORGET"" than a gentle reminder.

Arriving literally 1 minute late, and steps outside the restaurant, a hostess called me and basically said ""WHERE ARE YOU""... and I said well I'm right outside and she's like ""HURRY COS ITS THE LAST SEATING""....

When I got in, I didn't get a gentle hello or warm welcome but instead ""WE HAVE TO HURRY, COS THE LAST ORDER IS AT 2:45 PM""

And when seated at the table, a waiter was like ""WELL WE MUST HURRY because the KITCHEN CLOSES""... and upon ordering a dish (Hake), he sternly corrected my pronounciation.

It did not seem like service was a consideration at all, even by British standards where they don't work for their tips.

Food was a+, service was f-"
Brat,1,19-May-24,5,"The food was amazing, the anchovy bread is a must try. Great wine list and friendly team members."
Brat,1,23-Feb-24,5,"Brat

Tucked away in a former strip club is this cozy, dimly lit restaurant cooking plates inspired by the beautiful Basque Country.

Fire is central to everything they do and that's evident from the smell of smoke that penetrates the bar as soon as you walk through the door.

Chef Tomos Parry, who made a name for himself at fashionable Kitty Fischer's in Mayfair, focuses on simple dishes executed perfectly. Whole grilled seafood ('brat' is an old English word for turbot) sits alongside their delicious housemade breads topped with olive oil and sardines.

The cherry on top of this whole experience was their basque cheesecake with rhubarb. To say we could have eaten three or four slices would be an understatement."
Brat,1,31-Dec-23,5,RECOMMEND! Brat is a delightful small restaurant with a cozy vibe and delicious food. Service is top shelf -- including the reservation process -- who accommodated a 1 hour push back of our start time because of a long running theater show and traffic. Its dining area and kitchen are one space so many are treated to a view of the wood fired stove and chefs at work. Many interesting menu options from the starters to mains right through to dessert. Enjoy!
Brat,1,26-Nov-23,3,"Visited BRAT in London lured by its Michelin Star. Ambiance was nice with an open kitchen and grill. Tables were placed close together but managed to create a cozy and not claustrophobic vibe. Service was very good.

The food, unfortunately, was generally disappointing. We ordered the roasted clams, chorizo and puffed bread to start. All were tasty but the portions were very small especially for the price point. For example, the chorizo was effectively 4 small bites.

Most disappointing was our main - a whole grilled turbot - the restaurant's signature dish which we ordered for the three of us to share. What was presented to us was a soggy fish swimming in an unpleasant gelatinous liquid with little flavor except for smoke from the fire. It was so completely off putting we barely touched it.

We had really looked forward to this meal and left shocked by the experience and confused the restaurant had obtained a Michelin star."
Brat,1,31-Oct-23,2,"BRAT, Spoiled

Ate 2X at BRAT in 2019. Food very good; service OK. Returned 4 years later and was quite disappointed. Booked for 1 person and when I arrived they
tried to put me at an uncomfortable counter seat. Asked for a table and it worked out. Starter of chorizo was tasty.

When I ordered a glass of 19gbp wine with my main, the wine list said ""coravin"" which I assumed was a coravin system. Instead I saw the server pour from an open bottle. When she brought the wine, I asked her about the coravin, but she seemed flustered. Plus the pour was quite meagre; I then
asked the sommelier and he said ""oh your server made a mistake"". I asked
about the meagre pour and he said ""135 milliliters is what we pour for a glass"". OK whatever.

My flustered server disappeared and as time stretched on, I wondered where
my main of Turbot pil-pil with potatoes was. After 25 minutes, another
server dumped the plate on my table, not even saying anything.

The food was lukewarm and although tasty, it lacked salt. I ate about half of my main and as it had gotten cold, it became unappetizing. When the server came to take away the plates, she asked how the food was. I said it was tasty, but it was served almost cold.

A few minutes later, the manager was looming over me, asking ""were there problems with the food ?"" I replied yes food was served lukewarm, so it got cold on the plate. He replied ""you have been rude to my staff so I am asking you to leave."" I replied that I was by no means rude, but I had questions about the coravin and when asked I told a server my food was cold.

Moral of the story: BRAT is now a tourist joint where a customer dare not complain. Chef Parry makes nice food, but his staff is entitled, lazy and do not understand the concept of hospitality. I will be pleased to never return
to BRAT."
Brat,1,18-Oct-23,3,"brat has a real WOW factor and is most definitely where you will find the young, hip crowd. It is a place to be seen, and the communal dining environment lends itself to that. Our table for two was a row of 4 or 5 double tables, which is great for eyeing what others have ordered but not so great for quiet conversation.

The restaurant itself is located off the beaten path and really beautiful on the inside, in that hip, cool kind of way.

Like the wonderful people who grace the UK, service was warm and gracious. The menu is interesting and there really does seem to be something for everyone.

We shared -

- Grilled bread and anchovy. Comes to the table as a beautiful, bulbous piece of bread that quickly deflates once you cut into it. There were 4 or so strips of anchovies on top, but I really would have loved some in the filling.

- Spider Crab and tomato. My niece found this to be one of her favorite dishes at brat. Personally, I found the crab to be quite fishy but admittedly, it is not my favorite crustacean. If you love crab, order it. If not, perhaps a pass.

- Fresh chorizo. You look at the photo I posted and you may say, heck, there's a lot of fat in that chorizo. Well, yes. It's fatty, incredibly tasty and wonderfully delicious. We loved it.

- Langoustine. While we expected a small portion (it only costs 8 pounds!), there was so little meat it was a very disappointing dish. Particularly because the meat you did get was such a sweet treat.

- Menai Oysters with tomato & seaweed. We ordered 4, I ate 1. My niece and I love oysters and I typically devour them. These were not our favorites. With that said, full transparency, I was not a fan of the oysters I ate in the UK. All good in that there were plenty of things I really did enjoy!

- Lamb chops. We ordered two and they were absolutely perfectly cooked and delicious. If I were to go back to brat at some point I would likely order 2 of these chops for myself.

- John Dory. I've heard of John Dory/St. Peter's fish for years, but never had the opportunity to order it. When I saw it on the menu I knew it was a must-have. Sorry for no photo, but it's not the prettiest fish ;) The fish is served whole and the easiest way to get to the meat is to lift the bone out (I didn't figure that out early enough in the process). The fish itself was utterly delicious and I now know that I love John Dory. With that said, even being a whole fish, just didn't seem like a heck of a lot of meat.

I believe over the course of dinner we had a total of 4 glasses of wine. The total cost of our bill (tips are included) was $240.86, which I actually found quite reasonable.

brat has oodles of positive reviews, so take mine for what it is worth. The food actually shines in its simplicity which is something I personally love as I'm not a big fan of hiding under too much sauce/gravy. For me, dishes were hit or miss. You may love it as many of its fans do."
Brat,1,30-Sep-23,5,"Brat is a Michelin-starred basque restaurant in Shoreditch. Although space is a bit cramped, the food, wine list and service are great. Order a number of smaller plates to share so you get a full sense of the range of food and tastes of the Basque region."
Brat,1,13-Sep-23,5,A near religious experience. One of my favorite restaurants I've tried in London after being so hyped up by the press. The restaurant itself is an open-kitchen concept with a focus on wood-fired cooking. Each dish was executed with such attention to detail but the basque cheesecake was truly what set the experience apart. And pricing was so fair for what it's worth.
Brat,1,5-Sep-23,2,"The service was incredibly slow. No one came to check up on our table for most of the dinner. We did not have one dedicated server and instead had to call to numerous people. Flagging our waiter down in this particular restaurant is especially chaotic given how loud it is and how close you are to other people. The restaurant has a very crowded feel, which would be fine if we felt we were regularly being checked in on.

The food was not properly salted at all. The most egregious dish is the duck rice. Most of the rice we received was overcooked and firmly stuck to the pan. The duck and rice tasted bland."
Brat,1,5-Sep-23,3,Too many flaws - a good restaurant fairly reasonably priced - lamb and beef dishes seem to be what they do best - Fantastic lamb and sweet bread dish and a great tartare - all else so so - noisy and cramped - servers try hard but it's tough layout
Brat,1,29-Aug-23,3,"The food here was delicious. Almost everything we ordered was extremely tasty, and I thought the food was both well prepared and well plated.

I am not super happy. We were seated almost a full hour after our reservation, which meant we ended up, leaving the restaurant over two hours beyond when we were supposed to be seated. With a little one in tow, this meant bedtime was pushed back and he was cranky.

The servers also weren't very accessible, and some of them were downright rude. When we asked to order more food, they gave us a condescending ""you've had quite enough"" vibe. We finished all of our food for the record!

I think this would be a great date spot, or place for young couples. Not very family friendly.
"
Brat,1,9-Aug-23,5,"This was our first meal in our first our first night in London. We had seen it featured on somebody feed Phil, so we came to check it out ourselves. This was every bit worth the hype. Unfortunately, we didn't order the turbot because they warned us it would be too much for two people, but everything we did order was fantastic. My favorite thing was the scallop - I love scallops and order them often but this was probably the best scallop I've ever had. The char and flavor were perfect. We also ordered the toast with onion butter, red pepper side dish, crab on toast, and sirloin. I would recommend it all. Our waitress was also very friendly and gave us great recommendations. If I'm ever back in London, I'd love to come back here."
Brat,1,30-Jul-23,5,"One of my favorite meals I've ever had in my life. Such a great variety of flavors with super friendly service and in a super cool space.

Had their special of the day, the langoustines which were absolutely delightful. Super fresh seafood"
Brat,1,25-May-23,5,"Wow. Such a great meal at brat. Didn't know what to expect, but from start to finish the food was excellent and the attentiveness and service of the staff was the best. Really enjoyed the oyster and chorizo bites. The real standout was the crab soup... warm, seafoody and complex, this was truly a special dish. Sardine bread was also excellent. Even the grilled bread was excellent.

Thanks brat for the best meal I had on this trip to London."
Brat,1,24-May-23,3,I visited on my vacation and came after watching a Conde Naste Youtube video. I suppose I expected more since this place has a Michelin star. The restaurant is small but hip and open. The food wasn't anything to write home about. I was only impressed by the crab soup since the seafood flavor was intense. I got the grilled fish and it was okay. I wish there was more texture to it.
Brat,1,22-Apr-23,3,"I didn't like brat unfortunately. Very Smokey inside which made it hard for me to breathe. Was quite expensive so that's disappointing since I didn't like anything I ordered, including drinks."
Brat,1,22-Apr-23,5,"A friend and I found this gem while strolling around near our hotel.

This was one of the best accidental finds in my life. Every single item ordered from the menu was incredible. The service and staff were friendly, helpful and so generous with their time explaining the dishes.

In fact, our server even took the time to explain where our next stop should be after dinner. Gave us directions and who to ask for.

The next time I'm in London; I'll make it a point to go back. You will not be disappointed."
Brat,1,12-Mar-23,3,"Honestly, would just return for the cheesecake.

The grilled bread with green garlic was good but very oily on top. Well baked and tasty, feel like it would be better on the side of something. The lamb was not great. So fatty that it was not appealing, and not much flavor to it.

The cheesecake though... maybe the best cheesecake I've ever had. Soft and rich, almost like a custard on the very middle, but fluffy on the outer parts. Truly phenomenal. But I don't get the rhubarb on the side. It adds nothing, and is not particularly flavorful on its own either."
Brat,1,27-Jan-23,5,The small plates here really stood out. House made chorizo could have been my favorite. Grilled bread w chanterelles was awesome. They really do bread well here. Leeks + cheese good. Tartare good. Shared a big fish that was fun to pick at and I know its one of the specialties but I think I liked the small dishes more. A group of 4-6 here vs a party of 2 would be ideal. Can try so many more items. Need reservation.
Brat,1,23-Jan-23,5,"In my research on where I was going to go during my trip to London, I stumbled upon Brat. A one Michelin Starred joint that exclusively cooks with fire. No electricity. Just fire. From my table, I could see a massive, wood-burning oven and a giant firepit with grates at three different height levels, presumably for different heat intensities. I've heard of places like this, and I was excited to try one out for myself.

We started off with the Grilled Bread (with Girolles & Berkswell). We saw them throw it in the oven, bake right in front of our eyes, and then get adorned with some cheese and the mushrooms. A slight char, flavorful, salty cheese, and the umami from the mushrooms made this a true banger.

We ordered a small plate next, the Lamb Chop with Grilled Sweetbreads. The lamb chop had that same, good char. Tender and simply seasoned. Served with a couple of sweetbreads, which, if you've never had, you should. They are officially a new texture for me, a slight creaminess. Very unique. Very delicious.

Then we ordered a main, the Lemon Sole. A whole fish, face and all, trapped in a cage and roasted over the fire. Charred, barely seasoned, the meat singing its own praises. There aren't a lot of experiences as visceral as eating a whole fish. Amazing. FYI, though, this fish had both more and smaller pin bones that you average fish, so you're gonna work for your prize.

Then we got another main, the Roast Duck Rice. This dish was unbelievable. The rice was cooked in the duck fat, the duck was ultra crispy, and the whole mushrooms and slices of onion just made this campfire-like dish so unctuous. Very heavy, with no relief, in a good way.

With all our food, we got a couple of sides, the Smoked Potatoes and the Wood Roasted Greens. Both great. Buttery potatoes served whole, so you get that pop of the skin with every bite. The stuff of dreams. And the green were nice. Not like, mega delicious, but you need that freshness to break up the heaviness of the whole meal. It was covered in that same cheese that was on the bread. A good side.

Then it was time for dessert, the Burnt Cheesecake & Nectarine. The cheesecake was pure velvet. Amazing. It was covered with a fine layer of ash on top, which sounds not good, but it was very good. I think the one I had was served with a pear, as opposed to the new menu version, but either way, a slice of fruit complements this well, because the flavor is very neutral. Overall, great.

Overall, I loved this place. Everything they served looked so dang rustic, like it was served to me at a campsite, right out of the fire. But at the same time, it was delicate, and worthy of Michelin's attention. I also liked the way they highlighted various ingredients. The same mushrooms and cheeses kept showing up in their different dishes in different ways, and they played a good part. Yes, come here. It's a winner."
Brat,1,1-Jan-23,2,"Really disappointing. The scallop and the leek with fresh cheese were great, but we also ordered live lobster, the beef rib, and also asked the somm for a bottle of wine and they were all very disappointing.

The lobster (76 pounds!) was small and was not fresh. We often eat lobster and eating it in Chinatown or Dishoom is way more fresh and cheaper.

We asked for the rib to be cooked medium and parts of the massive rib (over 90 pounds!) were way over that it was chewy and dry. The flavor of the steak was good but cooked poorly, and it was soaking in this weird sauce that was unnecessary. We also ordered the mushroom dish which was not delicious.

The bottle of wine suggested by the somm (65 pounds) was not memorable or delicious. Just any table wine but costs more.

Very disappointed. We can New Year's Eve. Didn't care that we had to wait for the food but was not good for the price."
Chez Bruce,1,28-Dec-22,5,"This place is just fantastic! Haven't been in years and it continues to be excellent. The cooking is exceptional, the service on point, wine list great and cocktails perfect. It has a star and not hard to see why. Yet it's totally unpretentious. You could go for a date, with friends (as long as they're fine w the slightly elevated price) or family. It's so flexible. Highly recommend."
Chez Bruce,1,15-Apr-22,5,"Chez Bruce is a modern French restaurant in a lively area of South London, I went here for a late Mother's Day blowout.

The service is exceptional, glass top ups were frequent as were offers for more bread and snacks in between courses. Staff are very friendly and accommodating and in absolutely no rush to turn over tables. The ambience grew in stature as the afternoon aged, staring off very quiet to then becoming delightfully lively an hour or so into our sitting.

We tried a variety of food and wine, all of which were faultless - some of the things we had are pictured. It was a pricey lunch but for me fully worth it, especially since it's a business in our local area. I would certainly come here again when the menu changes!"
City Social,1,12-Jul-24,3,"The discreet entrance at ground level of Building 42 needs improvement. It is somewhat confusing and dark, unbecoming of a Michelin-starred establishment. However, once you arrive on the 24th floor via the speedy dedicated elevator, the stunning views of Greater London make a strong first impression. The overall look is impacted by its dark interior, but the decor is elegant and focused on comfortable-looking circular booths with views of the impressive Gherkin building (photos included).

- **Prices**: Despite the location, Michelin status, and quality, the prices are extremely reasonable.
- **Food**: The menu is not very diverse, but it offers good starter options. Bread with caramelized onion butter was a nice addition, but the cocktails were average, with the ""Pear-a-dise"" being my favorite. The shrimp ravioli and the seabass were my choices. However, the servings are small and the taste average. The food presentation was fine, but not outstanding. There is nothing in the plates we order that needs to be mentioned as remarkable. Again, the food is not bad, but average.
- **Service**: The service was also average, neither excellent nor professionally trained. The staff did their best to make our dinner special, but they seemed to lack knowledge about the menu. For a Michelin restaurant, you expect a more proficient staff. In comparison, in any other restaurant, their level of service would be acceptable.
- **Ambiance**: Definitely not ideal for a romantic dinner. The bar, located at the entrance of the restaurant, has loud music and lots of people chattering, which echoes throughout the dining room. It was quite a noisy meal.

**In Summary**: The restaurant is average but nice. I would not return, but I recommend this place for the views. It is definitely not deserving of a Michelin star based on the food and service, which were good but lacked Michelin quality.
"
City Social,1,24-Jun-24,4,You have to go up an elevator to get to the floor that the restaurant is on. The restaurant is upscale and classy. Great views of London. The white wine we got was also very good here. Food was not so good - we all had gotten steak and they were completely cooked wrong and 2 of them were almost raw. We sent them back and most of them didn't get fixed to how we wanted them. Service was okay staff stuck up. 4 stars because of the view otherwise would be 3 stars.
City Social,1,20-May-24,3,"Million dollar view, probably the worst Michelin star restaurant I've tasted so far. I was wondering why it was so easy to get a table and by 7pm on Friday now the restaurant was not full, the menu explained it all. The presentation was ok, but the taste from appetizers to main course was not impressive at all."
City Social,1,2-Aug-23,5,The service was top notch. The food was amazing. And the view was incredible. Everything completely exceeded my expectation.
City Social,1,6-Jul-23,3,The place was difficult to find. The view was amazing even on a foggy day. Wine selection was good. My husband and I ordered lobster ravioli. He was happy with his I thought mine tasted weird and he confirmed it. I become unwell shortly after. Truly a letdown as the place came well recommended from our concierge.
City Social,1,13-May-23,5,"Without exaggeration, this place served me the best lobster linguine I have ever tasted. The food is delicious - from starters to desert I had been blown away by the flavours, with some unique exotic twists.

Additionally, the views are spectacular, with broad windows overlooking the city. Truly a romantic scene when you come in the evening.

Nothing to fault about the place. The staff are wonderful and I'll be sure to make another booking soon."
City Social,1,23-Mar-23,5,Went here for dinner and it was amazing! The view was beautiful as well as the food. They got some pretty good gluten free bread. Service is great too. There's also a stool for your bag next to the table.
City Social,1,24-Jan-23,5,"I came here for dinner with work friends and we had a great time - talk about a view from your seat at the restaurant - and the food was very good and the service was excellent. We had a variety of appetizers, and it is hard to say what was better the steak or the lobster ravioli: I'd also recommend having the bartender shake you up a vodka martini. If you walk out of here hungry, something is wrong!"
City Social,1,25-Dec-22,2,"Come for the views, not the flavor.

Mediocre service and flashy food that lacked inspiration; not the dining experience we expected from a Michelin star.

As you approach City Social, you're greeted with a metal detector and a coat check and then you head up the lift for what we hope would be a memorable London dining experience.

We were early, so we were sat in front of the window at the bar area. The views are truly spectacular and definitely the highlight of the evening.

After sometime, we were greeted by a server to take our drink order. We ordered two specialty cocktails and it was quite obvious the server knew very little about the menu.

The drinks were fantastic. City Social's best people seem to be behind the bar. We also had a great experience with the sommelier that was as fun as they were knowledgable.

We sat for an extended period of time before someone finally came over and took our order.

We ordered the scallop, the prawn/lobster ravioli, and the lobster tail salad.

The appetizers looked nice, but the flavors fell flat.

The prawn/lobster ravioli was my personal favorite, but even that was underwhelming. When we come to restaurants like these we hope to taste something new, but the appetizers were just not that interesting.

The main courses were more of the same. The duck was good, but pretty standard. Nothing to write home about.

Dessert was good. I would actually say the drinks and dessert were the only shining moments of the evening. If I were to come back to City Social, it would likely be for drinks and a dessert and to enjoy the views.

That being said, if you're coming for an inspiring Michelin star meal, I would look elsewhere."
City Social,1,6-Dec-22,5,"I was invited to this restaurant for an exclusive networking event. It was a 5 course meal that did not disappoint! Everything was delicious. It is honestly the most beautiful meal I've ever had. Every dish was explained and there was plenty of wine to go around as well as cocktails on demand. I wish I had taken pictures of every dish, but I was too distracted being immersed in the experiences.

The company putting on the event hired the Chef's table which has a beautiful view of St. Paul's cathedral and central London; as well as a window into the restaurant's kitchen where you can see the food being prepared. The room was just the right size. Even though there were about 14 of us, it felt intimate and everyone could talk with each other around the table. I was surprised as usually round tables of 10 are very awkward yet this one, which was for a bigger party felt cozy.

I definitely recommend it."
City Social,1,18-Nov-22,3,"We were excited to celebrate my wife's birthday at City Social which is decorated with one Michelin star. The view at the restaurant is impeccable! It's located in the heart of London with lots of high rise buildings. We were able to see the Shard and the Gherkin! We arrived early around 5 pm, so we were guided to their bar area for a few drinks. The cocktail, wine, and spirits selections were wonderful. My cocktail Honey Moon was great! They even have non alcoholic cocktail option that was good as well. It was a beautiful restaurant surrounded by all the city lights.
When the dinner room is open, we were invited to the dinner table. Their sourdough bread with onion and chive butter was great! Very delicious. We started with their beef tartare and scallops. The beef tartare was different than the typical beef tartare. The beef was in bigger chunks and the sauce was more vinegar based. I felt the flavor was simple, almost too simple that I wasn't impressed. The scallops starter was wonderful! Layers of flavors and beautifully plated food. It was the highlight of the evening. My main entree was the sea bass with calm chowder based sauce. Beautiful plate, but the overall taste was too salty for me. The portion was solid, but I wasn't impressed by the flavors. It wasn't bad, but I was certainly expecting more from a one star Michelin restaurant. The rib eye steak wasn't impressive neither. We definitely had much better rib eye from a regular restaurant before. Overall, we enjoyed the opportunity to celebrate the birthday dinner at a beautiful restaurant; however, I was disappointed by the food. I was hoping to be blown away by their award winning flavors."
City Social,1,2-Sep-22,5,"First experience at a Michelin restaurant, it did not disappoint. Was very luckily to get a reservation on short notice. Everything from drinks, food, dessert and service was beyond anything I've ever had. The view was pretty nice as well. Will definitely try and visit whenever in London."
City Social,1,3-Jul-22,5,"Amazing food and incredible views - plus the service wasn't to be matched. The staff was courteous and friendly, and even took us on a tour to see multiple views and a peek in the kitchen. Overall a great experience!"
City Social,1,17-Mar-22,5,"Amazing dinner with views!!!! Probably my favorite in London so far. We went for my birthday and I would not have wanted it any other way! The scallops, sea bass, and rest all were amazing. Get the apple dessert. It was phenomenal and the perfect way to end our meal."
Dining Room at The Goring,1,20-Jun-24,5,"Wonderful afternoon tea on the Veranda. Beautiful space, polite and pleasant service..overall experience was wonderful!"
Dining Room at The Goring,1,14-May-23,5,"Everything perfect. Service, food and ambient.
Went for the Beef Wellington and it was great.
Definitely a must comeback."
Dining Room at The Goring,1,12-Jan-23,4,"I'm not sure what to say about The Dining Room at The Goring, but I'll give it a try since I'm writing this review.

Incredible service. They had people for everything. They were on top of everything. There wasn't a moment when I was wanting for anything. Probably the best service I've ever had at any restaurant, with a caveat... The sommelier was shockingly unprepared. My girlfriend asked the somm what he would suggest for her main. He picked up the wine book, made a ""hmm"" noise like he was thinking, and then would make half-hearted suggestions. ""Sauvignon Blanc usually goes well with seafood so maybe one of those?"" And then would point at a list of Sauv Blancs. I was just surprised that a somm at a restaurant such as this wouldn't have been more prepared with a solid answer. Anyhow.

The food was very good. Not great... But very good. My bisque was amazing. But nothing else was overly rememberable? I'm struggling to recall what I even had. Again - this is my complaint with restaurants of this caliber. So much attention is focused on the presentation and service and not a lot of energy goes into creating food that blows your hair back. But with that - one thing that impressed me was the temperature of the food we received. Everything was just hot enough without being too warm. Love that.

Fanciest restaurant I've ever been to, and probably the most expensive. Not sure it was worth the money, but I enjoyed the experience and have no real regrets."
Dining Room at The Goring,1,1-Nov-22,5,"Had afternoon tea here and it was amazing! The dining room is decorated and traditional British style, with lovely large windows to let in the light. The afternoon tea comes with many selections of tea to choose from, pastries, the most delicious scones and clotted cream I've ever had, and delectable finger sandwiches. The staff is attentive and hospitable. I was researching which afternoon tea to choose I'm so glad I chose this one!"
Dining Room at The Goring,1,8-Mar-22,3,The server was a total snob. I was disappointed. I've been to better hotels and this guy thought he was too cool for school. I give it a 3/12/ stars. I would not go back.
Galvin La Chapelle,1,14-Oct-23,1,"At Galvin La Chapelle I experienced the worst service of my life. After being seated, a waiter did not come to our table for 50 minutes. We ordered the 7 course tasting menu and didn't receive the 3rd course until after 2 hours of being seated. The entire meal we were neglected by the waitstaff, which included a buffoon of a sommelier who spent more time coughing all over our table than he did describing the wines. When he finally made a wine recommendation, the wine that showed up was sickeningly sweet and tasted nothing like his description.

The 3 dishes that we did eat were mediocre at best, and far below the ""Michelin"" caliber we expected. I will never come back here and advise you to spend your evenings and money elsewhere. A true embarrassment to fine dining."
Galvin La Chapelle,1,13-Oct-23,5,"what's not to like about this establishment? Certainly delivers on its 1 M star.

We intended to do the tasting menu, but then decided against it as there were several shellfish items that I couldn't have - and I didn't want the veg substitutes. Besides, the a la carte menu had several of the items we wanted to try anyways - so we decided to go with that option - and get 6 items that we could share.

Drinks were excellent! The food even better. Beautifully laid out, and delightful to taste. The only gripe would have, if you could call it that, is that the steak dish just had a bit too much going on on the plate. While the steak was amazing, and paired well with the foie gras, there were just too many additional flavors of the sauce (loved it!) and the individual vegetables. The additional, small beef tip piece completely stumped me - though I enjoyed that as well.

Service was impeccable - attentive, but not overbearing, nor intrusive. Couldn't fault them on this front.

Certainly well worth the visit."
Galvin La Chapelle,1,29-Jan-23,4,We dined here for a client meeting & it was nice. The ambiance of the restaurant is great. It appears to be inside an old building & is a beautiful building. The entrance is really welcoming with lots of flowers. Service was very attentive & great. The food was smaller portion sizes but definitely still enough. I enjoyed it & would be back.
Galvin La Chapelle,1,6-Jan-23,5,absolutely loved this place. incredible service and the best food i've ever had. I will definitely be back.
Galvin La Chapelle,1,10-Feb-22,4,"Ordered the dinner 7 course tasting menu for two. The interior and service are very impressive. All of the dishes, however, were too sweet for my liking. I would prefer more savory than sweet. The dry aged beef was too tough for chewing also. For a Michelin star, I expected a bit more. Dessert and cocktails were amazing though. 3 1/2 stars in my book."
Harwood Arms,1,27-Apr-24,5,Amazingly surprised. If there is such an expression. This is a Michelin restaurant. And well worth it. Entrees and main dish are highly original in taste and presentation.
Harwood Arms,1,5-Apr-24,5,Amazing game offerings in a tasteful and adventurous setting. Excellent service staff. Don't miss this gem!
Harwood Arms,1,1-Mar-24,5,"We really loved The Harwood Arms. It is such a pleasure to have exceptional food in a casual, relaxed setting. The dining room is rustic and cozy. And even though The Harwood Arms is a pub, the service is top notch.

The food is classic British cooking with a focus on game and wild meat. My favorite dish was the venison scotch egg with Oxford sauce. It was beautiful with a runny golden yolk. My only complaint is that it came out with instead of ahead of my starter as requested.

The thyme flavored sauce on the rabbit lasagne was phenomenal. The Berkshire Fallow Deer was perfectly cooked and served with mushrooms and onions. They had dessert special, a date custard tart, that we were lucky to get.

I also enjoyed their gin list and tried three different English gins, each one delicious.

I highly recommend it."
Harwood Arms,1,25-Nov-23,5,"We visited on Sunday for roast dinner - Oh my! Great location in quiet neighborhood. Old corner bar full of charm and friendly staff. We arrived without reservations and between meal rushes and after a drink at the bar we were seated. The Sunday roast is an event, served for two with plenty of everything. See picture. Great tasting food, gravy and veggies - haven't head a better Sunday roast. We were never rushed and felt like we were eating at a friend's home. Great meal and experience"
Harwood Arms,1,7-Nov-23,5,Great food and a great environment. We were lucky to get a table and it was an amazing experience. Highly recommend!
Harwood Arms,1,28-Oct-23,5,"Dinner at Harwood Arms was absolutely exquisite from beginning to end. It's the only Michelin-starred pub in London, and although it's definitely a posh experience dining here, it doesn't feel stuffy or pretentious. It still has a level of comfort.

The staff was attentive and patient. One member of our group got an important phone call from her son in the United States and had to step out to talk to him for a few minutes, and they gave us some space and never made us feel like we were wasting their time as they waited to take our orders.

The food is absolutely fantastic. From the wonderful brown bread and perfectly creamy butter, to every other bite of food that graced our table.

The onion tart was exceptional, the tomato was so perfectly balanced with the most adorable little croutons for texture, all of our main courses and especially the best potatoes ever, which were twice cooked, boiled and then fried in GARLIC BUTTER! They were so crispy and delicious. I couldn't get over it. Dessert too absolutely hit the mark.

This meal was another one of those totally memorable, totally must bookmark this spot and return on any future visit to London because it was truly that good. It is worth going out of your way to eat here, trust me."
Harwood Arms,1,19-Oct-23,5,One of the best restaurants I went to while in London. There was 4 of us we all tried each other's food and I can tell you every single thing was amazing. It wasn't too rich or filling but just really good food. I loved the modern look of a pub style restaurant too. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone
Harwood Arms,1,7-Oct-23,5,"Great atmosphere, fish and chips was fantastic . Bar was an upbeat mix of all ages. Weight staff was very professional and friendly"
Harwood Arms,1,20-Sep-23,5,Service was great! Seated promptly. Food is cooked above restaurant and lowered in these dumb waiters. So cool! The venison was perfect. Didn't taste gamey at all! I didn't like the taste of a ground meat in my dish but it was okay. The beef short Rib was tender. Really loved the onion tart and Scotch egg. It was a great experience.
Harwood Arms,1,12-Sep-23,5,"I came here for dinner and absolutely loved it! The staff knew we were celebrating, so they gave us a card and an additional dessert. Those were very nice touches. It's nice that it's a prix fixe menu, so we were able to try every course. For my drink, I had the Kir Britannia, which was very good. For my starter, I had the seasonal vegetables, which came with smoked trout. It was absolutely beautiful to look at, and it was amazing! For my main, I had the fallow deer, which was also great! Our server gave us smashed potatoes with it, and they complemented each other nicely. For my dessert, I had the lemon thyme panna cotta, and it was so refreshing! We also had the apricot ice cream, and it was full of apricot flavor! Everything was outstanding, and I really recommend trying it out! The workers are really great, too!"
Harwood Arms,1,30-Aug-23,4,"We came for a late lunch with an absolute empty stomach but we were sooooo full we can barely fit in the dessert.

£65 per person for a three course menu but a supplemental £7.50 for the sirloin. There's a special steak for a supplemental £12.50 but we thought might try their standard first.

Alcohol is very high quality- I had the white wine (forgot which one but I always op for the second cheapest) and it was very very luxurious. My friend had the beer with champagne and it was very interesting in the best way.

We chose the pate and onion tart for our starter. Very tasty - perhaps we are hungry - and we literally inhaled it.

The deer - loved it as I'm a big fan of gamy stuff. It's on the salty side though so pair it with a potato is perfect. It was very yummy.

Sirloin was very nice actually. I was so skeptical because steaks are very tricky but they did it beautifully.

All the sides are great especially the giant crispy Yorkshire pudding but the only thing is they only gave us two strips of carrot :(

By the time it's dessert, we are already so full that we debate about packing it to go. This says a lot because we usually try to finish our food. But god that was good. It was so good that even with a max out stomach, I still found it tasty. And I'm not a dessert person.

The bill comes to around £180 with 3 drinks in total. Not cheap but the quality was definitely there. Never have I ever had such a posh pub meal before. Haha"
Harwood Arms,1,21-Aug-23,3,"Food 6/10
Great meal, but it was just not the type of food I enjoy the most. Scottish venison eggs and onion tart were the highlights of my meal. It was overall quite a rich and hearty meal, with no breaks, as we started with the rich scotch eggs, had some complimentary rye bread with whipped butter (delicious and warm), and ended with deer, mushrooms, in a creamy and heavy sauce. My stomach was not at its best when we ended this meal, but I did enjoy getting a chance to try the flavors.

Atmosphere 7/10
Very much a gastropub vibe. Dark wooden interior with fur decor (no clue if it's real or not). We were seated in a snug corner, vibes.

Service 5/10
Even though we were seated at 8:30, we didn't get to our main until 10pm, so it was quite a delayed meal. Wish it was faster, they were not as attentive as I had hoped."
Harwood Arms,1,7-Aug-23,5,"Hardwood Arms is a great value. The wife and I made a visit in August 2023
Nice selection of house cocktails, we each opted for a fancy gin and tonic
Also have an extensive wine list from around the world, we opted for a cote de Rhône
Dinner was a fixed priced at 65 pounds
We each had the onion tart for starters
For dinner the Ms. Selected the cod and I had the short rib
For dessert the wife had the cheese plate and i had the evening special which was apricot ice cream with a bunch of different crisps.
Overall the food was very well done, creative and the evening was memorable. Overall total was 265 pounds

If you are in London, check them out. You will not be disappointed.

Harwood Arms,1,24-Jul-23,5,"Very tight menu but something for everyone in our party of 6. All options were amazing. Service amazing. Wine by the bottle prices were a bit high, although the by the glass options were wonderful and well priced. Between all of us we tried and ordered 90% of the menu - thumbs up all around.

Great quiet location within a leisurely walking distance from Earls Court station. Very accommodating to one individual in our group who had a food sensitivity. Service was impeccable."
Harwood Arms,1,10-Jun-23,4,"We were excited to try The Harwood Arms to scratch our ""traditional English pub meal"" itch. We were pleased with the experience, but wish that a few things would have been better.

The place is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood and the decor is so charming--like an elevated pub-centric vibe. The sloe gin spritz was one of the best cocktails that one of us has ever had (she ordered two), and we appreciated that the goblet came with a straw that was the right size for the glass. It's a three course prix fixe menu, but we also started with the venison Scotch egg because 1) we love Scotch eggs and 2) we're in England. Needless to say, it was flawless. The yolk was perfectly runny, the meat was moist, the crumb was crisp. 10/10! Our daughter liked it so much that she had almost half of it.

We chose the warm pumpkin tart and spring vegetable salad for our starters course. The flavor of the pumpkin and goat cheese was a match made in heaven, but the filling had gone mealy, so the whole texture was off. The salad course was beautifully presented, but it was more like a Russian kind of salad with the focus being on the potatoes and sour cream. The components were individually arranged, so you really had to mix everything up to fully appreciate the dish. Our entrees were the best part of the meal (after the Scotch egg). We got the Cornish Hake and the short rib. BRAVO. Both dishes were flawless. The short rib was beyond tender and we loved that it was wrapped in the greens--the confit made you want to lick the plate. The fish was also incredible with a buttery flakiness that contrasted nicely with some of the firmer beans; the artichokes were a welcome addition.

Dessert wasn't the best. The blood orange trifle was definitely something special that you don't see everyday but some of the buttermilk components threw us off. We also had the apricot special that sounded right up our alley, but again, it seemed unnecessarily ambitions. The pastry layers were more like crackers gone wrong, and wish that there had been something else tying in all the other delicious elements together; still, we appreciated the ice cream and fresh fruit and creams.

Service oscillated from extremely warm to haughty brusque. They definitely seemed more harried as the place filled up, but we wouldn't necessarily say it was good or bad--more like, just managing to make the whole thing work. That said, we would highly recommend The Harwood Arms to others as it's definitely making pub food more inventive and exciting."
Harwood Arms,1,12-Mar-23,5,We visited the Harwood Arms a few years ago and at this is no different. Still the cozy but friendly atmosphere with good food.
Harwood Arms,1,12-Jan-23,5,"Outstanding. My girlfriend & I sought out restaurants with a Michelin star for our vacation, and Harwood Arms was one of the ones we selected. Of all the restaurants we chose for a vacation, Harwood Arms rose to the very top.

- The decor.
- The service.
- The food.
- The presentation.
- The vibe.
- The price.

Everything was great. I would go back to the Harwood Arms without question. I was so enamored with my meal that I forgot to take any photos whatsoever, ergo my pictureless review.

Just take my word for it. Go to the Harwood Arms and enjoy your experience."
Harwood Arms,1,8-Jan-23,5,"Fantastic 3 course meal. Some dishes we had: Smoked Eel Soup, Pumpkin Tart, Short Rib, Deer, Pineapple Upside Down Cake and Custard Flan"
HIDE,1,25-Jun-24,5,"HIDE The most beautiful brunch||"" Overall, the taste is good, but not amazing. The presentation is indeed very delicate, and the environment is very good.
The two of us ordered almost all the popular dishes in the store. The waiter advised us that we ordered too much, but in fact, the portion was not large and it was okay.

French toast with blueberry compote & crème crue It looks ordinary but I was shocked when I took the first bite. It has a strong milky flavor but is not greasy at all. It was a dish that was eaten in a flash. It was so delicious that I wanted to add an order immediately. I told my friend that I would eat two servings each next time.

Acai bowl with berries Delicious yogurt bowl, beautiful presentation, a must-order dish.
‍Black truffled scrambled eggs on toast The most anticipated black truffle scrambled eggs, the taste is actually a bit bland, and the edges of the toast are a bit hard.
Croque Monsieur This one has a stronger flavor, but it's also a bit hard, so hard to cut hahaha.

Ordinary mango, pickled with a little floral fragrance, but I've forgotten what it tastes like now.
Smoothie, my friend said it's also delicious, you can't go wrong with any of it.

Make an appointment, brunch is before 10:30, and then it's lunch. Opposite is Green Park, you can go for a walk after dinner to digest the food, it's really comfortable.

"
HIDE,1,25-Jun-24,3,"I've eaten at Hide three times--once for lunch and twice for dinner. I highly recommend it for lunch rather than dinner. The lunch menu was innovative, and the food presentation was exceptional. In contrast, my dinner experiences were unsatisfying and disappointing."
HIDE,1,5-May-24,5,I'll miss the Hide Bar but especially Amber. Last evening was her last after many years. I have a very special memory there and Amber was always the greatest.
HIDE,1,4-Apr-24,5,"We made a reservation for breakfast as we were headed back to the states later in the afternoon. Exceptional from start to finish. Such a spectacularly beautiful space, a sunny seat by the window perfect for people watching. The staircase is a piece of art. Their gourmet coffee selections were the perfect beginning. The honey mango was the best I've had in my life and melted in my mouth. The seasonal fruit was also delicious with a lemon verbena pour over. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the French toast with blueberry compote and a side of black pudding and I loved my Eggs Florentine with a lovely bright hollandaise and perfect super yellow runny yolk. I look forward to trying lunch and/or dinner when we are back in June."
HIDE,1,12-Jan-24,3,I tried the tasting menu. The presentation and wine selections were absolutely stunning. But I feel like the presentation overpowers the food overall. The food was okay and not amazing as I thought it would be.
HIDE,1,16-Dec-23,5,"Had an absolutely fabulous meal at Hide, my best during this trip to London. To begin with, Hide has a lovely bar in the basement floor. Really nice ambiance and great selection of top shelf liquor. Lively, but not overly crowded.
We had dinner in the room on the top floor. Tables well spaced and a nice view of Piccadilly.
Appetizers were all excellent but mine, the soft shell crab with a Thai green chile sauce was spectacular. The crab was crispy but not dry and the sauce had just the right amount of heat. The mains were also excellent. The halibut perfectly cooked with a nice sauce. I hit the jackpot with the loin rib of venison that was amazing. Cooked to the perfect temperature, with a killer juniper berry sauce.
We just had one dessert, the quince tart, with an amazing crust and tasty small scoop of ice cream, which was the perfect accompaniment.
Service was top notch and the wine list one of the best in London. Great range of selections, many of which are well aged. Sommelier was very, very knowledgeable and happy to assist.
Just a great dining experience that I highly recommend."
HIDE,1,6-Dec-23,5,Very cool restaurant with beautiful interiors and the food to go along with it. We went for brunch and ordered a couple of items below in the photos. And everything was excellent. We had the truffle eggs and toast which was good and also had the Croque Monsieur and added truffles. If I got the Croque Monsieur next time I don't think I would add the truffles though. It would be excellent without. I also had 2 cappuccino's one with the normal coffee and the other with a specialty coffee from Colombia and both were fantastic. The one from Colombia was a little stronger. Overall I would go back in a heartbeat to try more items. And try one of the other floors.
HIDE,1,10-Nov-23,5,"Another fantastic meal here. This visit, the courses were timed perfectly without any long gaps in service. The wine pairings were excellent and nicely complemented the delicious food. I highly recommend Hide!"
HIDE,1,2-Oct-23,5,"Hide is on the edge of Green Park. It is a beautiful and novel setting with lots of wood. The lower bar is charming, somewhat chalet themed. The wine cellar down there is amazing and you can ask for a tour with the sommelier. We ate a variety of dishes, fish mostly which was served beautifully. It merits is Michelin Star."
HIDE,1,24-Sep-23,4,"Well. The place is beautiful. The food was spectacular. The charcuterie of meats was served on a slab of slate with thin cuts of cured lamb, duck, beef and pork. The mackerel tartare with a lovely gratinee that melted into a lovely sauce came on a smoking icy display of seaweed. Well done on the drama. The others that had the pasta and the scallop appetizers were wowed. Our mains: The John Dory was was wrapped in a thin zucchini flower. So delicate and beautiful with the pale orange and green veins enveloping a perfectly cooked piece of fish. The sauces complimented nicely too. The duck was delicious and the lamb amazing. Reports at the table gave the octopus two thumbs up. Everything was prepared to perfection. The desserts--omg! The banana milkshake with the crisp ice cream bites! The best best best was the warm acorn cake with a warm salted caramel sauce doused in a liqueur of your choice--we went with a delicious smoky mezcal. Very well done!! Now comes the ""but."" The service. It felt like a soft opening. No one but the female sommelier could get their act together. We sat 45 min before a waiter approached to take an appetizer order. Uh . . . How about cocktails???? We gently asked for a cocktail menu and wine list. They brought an I pad --one I pad for a table of 5. Well that took a while. We ordered some apps, enjoyed the delicious bread basket and olives and settled in. There was a big gap before dinner came, but we were ok. It's just that we had two servers serving us, so we did not know whom we asked for what. The som was professional, so helpful and lovely. She served red and white, apologized for the wrong glasses (really? Michelin star reviewer, did you not order wine? I felt her pain) and tracked down a cocktail that was ordered 30 minutes before (and brought two). The waiters dress like busboys and the busser/water refiller was in a suit (and super wonderful). A bit confusing at the start. So--go for the food and as my son said to me, ""chill"" and enjoy. But this NYer says someone called in sick. Also--no one came to the table to ask if things were good/cooked properly etc."
HIDE,1,28-Aug-23,5,"We had an amazing dinner at the Hide restaurant today. From the moment we walked in, we were blown away by the elegant uniqueness of the dining room. We were given a table in the upper room, so we got to use the beautiful wooden staircase. We started with a flat bread appetizer (amazing!), then I opted for deconstructed vegetable lasagna (to die for!) and my husband ordered their lamb dish (he loved it!). Our side dishes were broccoli with vinaigrette and baby potatoes- both side dishes were full of unique flavors and were very tasty. Our dessert was the blueberry cobbler with amazing homemade ice cream. The dessert was just as divine and the cherry flavored black tea was absolutely amazing. We were literally blown away by how amazing the Hide restaurant was."
HIDE,1,6-Aug-23,4,"Food was good but not amazingly good as I would've expected from a starred place. I had the duck which was good, and the signature nest egg, which was too umami for me. The service was also slightly disorganized for such an establishment."
HIDE,1,2-Jun-23,5,"As reassuringly expensive ( think £300/head for five course tasting menu+ matched flight of wines) as you would want from a fashionable restaurant in Mayfair. The food varies from excellent to really very good. Service is friendly but precise- in particular I would commend the sommelier. She took care to answer all of our questions ( quite apart from doing a very good job). Design is also a big feature, from the architect Alex Haw's hallmark sweeping staircase, to the artful partial views into the kitchens. One to go to with someone you really like, particularly if someone else is paying.
"
HIDE,1,29-May-23,4,"Great staff and service. Beautiful dining room and artfully plated dishes. The food was good, but sadly didn't match the level of it's surroundings. The flavors were boring. Had the soft shelled crab, lamb and elderflower baba. The crab needed more depth, the lamb was well made but tasted like lamb from any mediterranean restaurant and the flavors and texture of the baba didn't really mesh."
HIDE,1,12-May-23,5,"This place was my favorite meal my entire trip through 4 European countries! And kind you I ate at multiple Michelins/top 50 restaurants. First of all, the restaurant is gorgeous. We sat on the second floor and got to walk up that gorgeous spiral staircase. We sat right next to the floor to ceiling windows with a few of the park across the street.

For the lunch menu, they start you off with a bread basket, charcuterie style meat beautiful plated on bones, and a couple other treats. I chose the trout tartare as my starter, pork for entree, and custard tart for dessert. My goodness everything was a hit, seriously. There wasn't anything I didn't enjoy. The custard tart reminded me of nata and I thought it was so smart to pair it with the cider! You usually sprinkle a little cinnamon on nata so I feel like the cider played to that concept. Sooo delish!

Service was great and food was paced well! The lunch menu is a great deal for those looking for a solid meal without breaking the bank too much.

"
HIDE,1,27-Apr-23,5,"Went to Above at Hide for their lunch, and absolutely loved the experience. Walking in, you can understand right away why this place got michelin star. Greeted by the gorgeous entrance is awe-striking oak staircase that I only might have seen in some pretty magazine. The top floor is light-wooded with delicate and elaborate decorations. You can tell even from the table, cutlery holders and plates that every single element has been so thoughtfully placed in such beautiful way such that we can enjoy every moment there.
Every staff were extremely kind to me - as soon as I was seated, a staff came to let me know if I need to charge my phone, there's a portable charger placed in the drawer of the table, and showed me the options for my menu. Another staff came with a drink cart to offer me drinks, and soon someone else came bringing out a little stool to place my bag.

I got their 5 course set lunch since I wasn't too hungry. Throughout my meal, I was so happy, every bite made me smile. With a serene view outside facing the Green park, immaculately created dishes with perfectly balanced flavours, not only my mouth but my eyes were also in awe and happiness.

Would recommend to anyone coming to London and would definitely come back when I'm back in London!"
HIDE,1,17-Feb-23,4,"Ok this place is def fancy so for a nice fancy breakfast next to the park amongst fancy people it's a good option.

You're going to see your average bored wealthy types who prob didn't earn their money but think they are important.

The service is very good. The food is beautiful....but the taste of things didn't quite match.

The croissant was amazing! Like shattering glass on the outside and fluffy and chewy inside. They bring you this lemon butter and different jams that were great.

Teas and coffees amazing!

The Avocado toast was meh. Your average hipster coffee shop could crush it.

The fruit salad was depressing the fruits were all flavorless.

God I sound like such a whiny beeyotch.

The place is beautiful, the crowd there made me feel like a poor person, the pastries seem the way to go for sure and I think I might go again for fun."
HIDE,1,30-Jan-23,5,"This was it. The final food I would be purchasing in London during my trip. One Michelin Star, customizable tasting menu, great buzz, sounded like a winner. So we get here super early, actually, and took about 60 seconds to find the front door, because it was hidden, but they have a bar downstairs, called Below Hide, which had some nice mocktails, so we killed some time there.

At the time of our reservation, we were lead up two flights of their absolutely gorgeous stairs to our section, Above at Hide. We got seated and started carefully making our decisions. Because this was another wonderful London restaurant where, for the majority of the courses, we got a choice of which dish we wanted. Love the options.

There were five- and seven- course options. We chose the five. The seven seemed to be a cheese plate and another dessert, which we would have loved to have, but I don't know, guess we weren't feeling it that night.

The whole experience started with Gem, Bread & broth, and Flesh & bone. Three little bites. Gem was a leaf of lettuce, with the purpose of being dipped in some grain or nuts or something, I can't remember, and to be used as a chip to that dip. It was fun. The bread was really good. Five very distinct varieties of bread in a basket, with a fine dollop of butter on a plate. Always love bread.

And the Flesh & bone was the most striking presentation. Fancy pork/beef, charcuterie style, wrapped around the ends of feathers, and what looked like a bone. Quick bite, one and done. Delicious, fun. A great start.

Another small dish was the Turnip with pine nuts, honey & eucalyptus. Finely cut up strips of turnip soaking in a honey eucalyptus broth. Very clean tasting, like a palate cleanser.

The last little small bite that we both had the same thing, before the dishes started differing was the Nest egg. This was a slowly, barely cooked egg mixed with super delicious mushrooms, served in a brown egg that had it's top cut off. Needless to say, very fun, very delicious. I wasn't to break the egg to lick the inside of the shell, because I wanted more.

Then, our tasting menu truly began. And unfortunately, their menu has already changed, so I have no idea what I ate. I say unfortunate, but I actually love that their menu is super seasonal, and probably changes frequently.

But I do know that I had an excellent monkfish in a dashi broth, a nice lobster in a cream sauce, a perfectly cooked dusk with some black currents, and another sweetbread. There were also a couple of nice desserts, a fresh fruit one with some homemade ice cream, and there was a very pretty pasty, made to look like a gemstone. Great fun.

Our last, shared small bites, were the Chestnut & malt pillows and the Acorns. Nut-filled, chewy nougat. And a crispy pillow full of dessert stuff I don't remember what is was, but it was fun, it was light, and it was a good way to wind down from the meal.

We paid the bill, got our cake-home baggy full of delicious cookies, and left.

Overall, this was a fun journey. I don't know how long this place has had the One Star, but they definitely seem like they're pushing for that second Star. Who knows. But yes, five stars. Come here.

"
HIDE,1,20-Jan-23,3,"I really wanted to like this place. The servers and sommeliers were superb. The appetizers and nest egg were creative and delicious but I felt the main entrees felt too busy, with clashing tastes.

They started off with bread ( I loved the black pudding) , lettuce and beet juice that all tasted great. The turnip served in the broth was excellent despite served cold.

However, the main dishes were quite the opposite to the appetizers and desserts in that they were unbalanced. the Chilean sea bass with the pear did not pair well in fact did not go well together at all and the scallops was just ok. My venison was tough and the flatbread was soggy and the wagyu was just ok. We did the 5 course menu but we were so full we skipped the optional cheese menu.

As for desserts the tarte tartin is very sweet but goes pairs well with the ice cream which balances it out. The rhubarb tartlet was ok but I found the pastry portion too delicate. The tarte tartin won for me.

Tbh I wish the nest egg could be it's own a la carte bc I find it unique and it sucked we had to do the tasting in order to get the nest egg.

The tasting menu and the regular a la carte menu are quite different.

"
HIDE,1,2-Jan-23,5,"This one-star Michelin star restaurant is a find. Teh mussel custard, chicken (yes chicken) and papillete vegetarian dishes were all delicious. Service was helpful and efficient. The total spend with tip was 163 pounds for two which did not include alcohol, but expresso and sparkling water. Bread was 9 pounds. For the money, the quality was high, and meal was more than worth the spend."

I recently came here for dinner and was very disappointed. To me, the most important aspect of any restaurant, Michelin star on not, is the food. The food here was palatable, edible, but not one dish stood out and the flavors were nothing special.

The service was abysmal. Highlights included:
- Being offered only the a la carte menu and having to request the tasting menu
- Getting the wine pairing and then each wine being put on the table with descriptors like, ""this is a sparkling wine."" There was a som on the premises, but he did not come to our table
- Sticky stems on the cocktail glasses
- Plates sitting untouched after a course for 10 minutes, and then a server coming to the table and saying, ""ya done?"" before taking the plates

I'm unsure if this was just an off night for this restaurant, but I wouldn't return, and I would advise people against coming here. The experience was a waste of time and money."
Jamavar,1,6-Jun-24,5,"One of the best Indian meals of my life. The Dehli butter chicken was amazing, the Saag Paneer was transcendent and alive with fresh spinach flavor, and the tandoori prawns were beyond fresh, with a perfect seasoning and just a kiss of char from the Tandoor.
I would not order the lobster or the kid mains again, but that's just my taste. I will absolutely return."
Jamavar,1,29-Apr-24,1,"We were travelling to London from NYC and got food poisoning. We called them to cancel our reservation and asked to waive the fee as a courtesy since we were there only for 3-4 days so there was no way for us to reschedule, the lady on the phone said she needs to confirm with the manager but as its health related they should be able to do a courtesy. They charged us anyway and when we disputed with our card, they counter disputed claiming their policy. This is the worst greediest experience I've seen at any restaurant. They are sending me emails, claiming their money with no empathy or understanding of a health situation. We live in NYC and have been to many Michelin star restaurants and never experienced this in London or NYC or anywhere. I have made a note to never go here again, London offers so many excellent Indian restaurants, stay away from this one."

Overall 4.0/5.0

Great spot just off Berkeley Square. A bit pricey but food was excellent. Would definitely come back."
Jamavar,1,2-Jan-24,5,Incredible food! Delicious drinks! Great service! We are from California - had high expectations of Indian food in London. This place exceeded our expectations in every way.
Jamavar,1,1-Jan-24,5,I been to this Reasturant on new year the food was so good and o had some drinks at downs the bar man Mr Tony he made amazing cocktails I loved there food and especially drinks.
Jamavar,1,22-Oct-23,5,"Service was awesome and the meal from start to finish was amazing including the drink & wine. Our top favorites were the milk pistachio cake, the morels dish, truffle kicchadi, and the paneer. Pulao & jamavar dhal were also cooked nicely. Can tell they use good ingredients and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. The restaurant is more upscale, so dress appropriately."
Jamavar,1,22-Oct-23,5,"Top notch Indian food in London that will not disappoint. Service is impeccable. Only thing is the music is a bit dance club like for dinner. Otherwise, will return another time."
Jamavar,1,13-Oct-23,3,"Not sure how they earned and maintain a Michelin star.

We went there with high expectations, and had the tasting menu.

Overall, the first several courses were amazing. They were absolutely perfect - though the lamb chops could have done with a little more spice. The last course of Butter chicken, daal makhani and saag paneer, with an assortment of naans were a bit of a disappointment. They were on the blander side, and the naans were cold and rubbery - not something one would expect in a tasting menu. The desserts were good, but not great. So, food good, but not 1-star worthy.

Presentation - non-existent! At most 2 of the courses were 'pretty', but the rest of them were quite unimpressively laid out - again, not 1-star worthy.

Service - this is where this restaurant completely lost us. We arrived on time, and despite making the reservation months ago, were given a small table right at the back of the restaurant next to the billing station. it was crammed and lacked any privacy. Service was unattentive, and we literally had to keep asking them for it. After the 1st course arrived, we still hadn't gotten our drinks. Upon reminding them of that, the waiter returned to our table and had to retake our drinks order. Ever heard of that in a Michelin starred restaurant??? They had been informed that I was allergic to shellfish - and so brought me a substitute for my 1st course. However, that simple fact was forgotten in the 2nd course serving. Luckily I asked - otherwise, I would have been in serious trouble.

Bottomline is that this is by far the worst service we've ever had a restaurant of this caliber. I wouldn't be surprised if they aren't able to retain it next go round."
Jamavar,1,7-Oct-23,3,"Still scratching our heads as to how this restaurant has a Michelin star. Most of the food was very good, but then there were several things that were lacking - that you never encounter in a restaurant of such rating.

The first thing we noticed as we entered was that all the brown people were seated towards the back of the restaurant...... many of the ""brown people"" were from the US - today's big spenders, but I figure these guys never got the message.

Service was absolutely lousy. We had to constantly call out to the staff for service. Our drinks required a reminder and arrived after our first course. I'm allergic to shellfish, and one of the courses they apparently forgot that..... a BIG no-no in my books - especially when I am extremely allergic to shellfish.

The first several courses of the tasting menu (we seemed to be the only people there doing the tasting menu) were amazing! However, the courses towards the end were just so-so. The butter chicken was a bit strange, the accompaniments - daal makhani and saag paneer were just about OK. The naans not great - in fact not even good - they were on the harder side and barely warm. The desserts while good, were just OK - and poorly presented. In fact all the dishes were presented rather poorly - with may be 1 of them being photo worthy.

SO, overall, lousy service. Not-so-good presentation of the dishes. Most food items were excellent - though lacking towards the end - so inconsistent quality. Given that ratings are generally based on the tasting menu, I won't be surprised if these guys lose their 1 star rating in the near future."
Jamavar,1,30-Aug-23,4,"We had tickets to a show at the West End so wanted to have a fancy dinner out. We made reservations and as soon as we arrived we were seated. They were attentive throughout dinner and very polite. The restaurant was elegantly decorated, a nice date place.
So to the important part, the food. I ordered the Old Delhi Butter Chicken and my husband ordered the biryani. We also had mixed breads for the table. For drinks, I got the lassi and my husband got the Spring Garden. The presentation was beautiful. The lassi had a small flower floating in it. It cut through the spice nicely. The Spring Garden was a refreshing fruit drink.
I really enjoyed the butter chicken. The sauce was great over rice or on the naan. The biryani came covered by a pastry cap that they cut off revealing a steamy bowl of well seasoned rice and meat. It was all very good but at twice the cost of average Indian food. However, average Indian food is still pretty good at arguably a better value. So ultimately, this is a special occasion place."
Jamavar,1,29-Jul-23,1,"We made a reservation for Jamavar months in advance. I asked the dress code and was told casual. When we arrived with our two teenaged boys, we were turned away at the door. The boys had on a button down collared shirt with khaki shorts. Apparently, casual didn't mean shorts no matter how nicely dressed they were. They then charged us $100 the next day for not making our reservation. We not only had to scramble for another dinner, but were charged for breaking our reservation. So disappointing."
Jamavar,1,24-Jun-23,4,"Yes it's fine dining and it lives up to to the standard. Great food and ambiance, ok service, CTM was good as was the garlic naan and rich, butter chicken was fine, lamb chops were undercooked and a rip off for the price, would go again minus the chops."
Jamavar,1,15-Jun-23,2,"We came with such high hopes and left hungry and disappointed. If you know what good Indian food is then you should avoid this place. It's too bad that Michelin was duped by the high prices, expensive building, and posh location in downtown London -- the food leaves much to be desired.

The menu is lovely but beware -- the portions are tiny and the flavors aren't fully developed. Appetizers seemed to do better for our group than main dishes -- they were beautifully presented and were widely enjoyed. The curries and main dishes all tasted the same and lacked depth. The naan was ok -- if not slightly over cooked.

If you get off spending 300 pounds on dinner that you could get for 50 from your neighborhood Indian place then please come here. Otherwise, steer clear."
Jamavar,1,18-Apr-23,5,"When you walk into the restaurant it feels like a club with the music in the background, not necessarily a fan of loud music when I go out for dinner. But it's cozy restaurant with beautiful decor. The best way to describe the food was homemade taste with elevated style. We had the aloo tiki, shami kabob, vegetable biryani and lamp chop kebabs. It's Indian spicy, which was perfect and the food was delicious. The cocktails were refreshing, we had the royal blush and the ginger mango mule. The waitstaff was great, felt like they were attentive to us and other patrons. We were treated to a small birthday surprise of ras malai at the end. Just a great place for any special occasion or dinner date. Believe me you will not be disappointed. We were visiting from the US and I've only had desi food like this a handful of times in the Bay Area and Vancouver."
Jamavar,1,12-Apr-23,5,"Fine Indian dining in London.. highly recommended.. the apetizers were good, lamb felt a bit like it was pressure cooked and then put in the masala ( I could be wrong) The upstairs seating is much better as when i went downstairs to the restroom felt it was a totally different atmosphere and not the same Jamavar i have been here few times. Prices are good and great place to spend a Friday night in London!
Bill turned out 222 pounds ($275) for 3."
Jamavar,1,14-Jan-23,5,"Amazing Indian food, great service, fantastic drinks!
Probably the best briani I had! Totally recommend."
Kai,1,28-Oct-23,3,"The Aromatic Crispy Duck was very dry, a poor choice, especially as the lamb we observed on the adjacent table which was occupied by a famous US tennis professional looked scrumptious. At this level, one would expect every choice to be spectacular."
Kai,1,6-Jul-23,5,"Easily one of my favorite restaurants in London. Conveniently located in Mayfair. This spacious and moody restaurant does evoke the spirit of big Asian cities like Tokyo and Hong Kong. We came with vegans and vegetarians and service was so helpful in having us make an informed decision.

We got wasabi shrimp which is a must get- nothing else like it. Also spicy chicken and the faux Peking duck which is absolutely sublime - I would eat it everyday if I could."
Kai,1,4-Mar-23,3,"Honestly disappointed. The service was a bit weird here. Outwardly friendly but not that helpful.

What I remembered of the food - the wasabi prawn was good but it's not that unique. It tastes like wasabi honey mustard on a shrimp tempura. And the pandan creme brulee had little taste of pandan and was quite liquid, not as set as I would have expected."
Kai,1,1-Mar-23,2,"My recent experience was not the first at this beautiful restaurant. I took my daughter to the afternoon tea. We arrived slightly early but we accommodated straight away as the table was already set. As I have a mobility issue, the hostess, very kind and polite found an alternative route which was a nice start. The waiter was very pleasant. However, the limited amount and variety of food was poor. The decor was splendid, we have awaited for the food for quite some time. 5 minutes after tea was served we were told that kitchen is closing, we had hardly a chance to taste anything we are asked what else do we want. We felt really rushed. The creme brulee was too similar with the cake served. In my opinion below average quality for a Mishelin star restaurant. Then waiter said goodbye as he had to leave. During less than 2 hours stay. Disappointing but it can happen. Also rose tea was a tea bag. We could not eat our money cakes, I asked to take them. Our waitress told us we cannot. I asked what do you do with these cakes now, she said we throw they away. I refused for the 1st time in my life to pay the service charge. She repeated it again So you refuse to pay the Service charge, Madam. Hm, I think something is seriously wrong with the Management. Poor experience and poor value for money. There are a number of places we have been and enjoyed more. It would be inappropriate to comment any further."
Kai,1,24-May-22,5,"5 stars for the fabulous afternoon tea service!

I did a ton of research on where to go for tea and Kai was an undiscovered gem my husband found for us. The tea is a little less traditional but an awful lot of fun from the moment you sit down to the perfectly set table. The tea is on the bottom floor of this dark and romantically lit restaurant (be warned, if you're there for the gram you may need a little extra light for the perfect shot) and only has a handful of tables so I'd highly recommend reservations. We arrived right when tea started at 3pm and stayed until the end time at 5pm - Kai offers unlimited refills of both the sweets and savories in addition to the tea so two hours was the perfect amount of time. The tea menu is fairly limited and most teas have an upcharge so note that the emphasis here is more on the food and experience than the brew (though it is served on the most perfect china set).

To start you get a sweet little cocktail (non-alcoholic available as well) with fun edible garnishes. Then a pot of conversation tea cookies arrives. Then the main course, a three-level tower of sweet and savory treats along with saucer-sized macarons and small jars of sweet toppings to put on them. Macarons instead of scones was a little upsetting to me and the only misstep as who wants to put clotted cream on a macaron?! We loved almost all of the savory options, the prawn on toast being our favorite and the hot soup being the least compelling. The sweets were a little less up my alley as I'm a chocolate girl but they had a wonderful selection of flavors that fit with the Chinese theme that chocolate doesn't play much of a part in. The biscuit cookie was pretty but stale and bland, the money cake we each had three of it was so good.

My favorite part of the Kai afternoon tea was the fabulous service. We were greeted and seated promptly, given ample refills and we felt completely comfortable despite being the least chicly-dressed people there that afternoon (we had come from a full day of walking in cold weather - everyone else had clearly arrived just for the tea ;p). Highly recommend!"
Kai,1,9-May-22,4,"Very beautiful restaurant interior and polite service. The food was artfully presented. The tongue numbing fish was fantastic. We were a bit disappointed by the chili lobster dish since it felt like for the price we paid, we didn't get much seafood. The pandan crime brûlée was fantastic though--a must order!"
Kai,1,17-Jan-22,5,A phenomenal restaurant well deserving of a Michelin Star - everything was so good - one of the best in London
Kitchen W8,1,3-Jan-24,5,Last night my wife and I celebrated our 40th anniversary. The meal experience was everything we hoped it could be. The food was creative and delicious. The homemade linguini appetizer was very flavorful! The cod and deer courses were wonderful! The service from Allegra and Dipika was exceptional! Anyone reading this should go and experience Kitchen W8 for themselves!
Kitchen W8,1,4-Aug-23,1,"Went here for dinner, I certainly hope that the Michelin reviewer returns here soon because there is absolutely no way the service or food here warrants a star. We had a hair in one of our diner's main dish, the service was inattentive at best and disappointingly unimpressive for a restaurant with a Michelin star. At $230 for dinner for 2 I would expect at least good food or good service but neither was provided except for the one chipper fellow who brought the bread and said goodbye on the way out. If only he had been our server perhaps things might have been at least a bit friendlier. My husband had also made the reservation and noted we were celebrating my birthday, they did not acknowledge this though we did see them seat another couple and then awkwardly ask them to move after they had been seated for a bit because another couple was celebrating their anniversary and they wanted that particular table. All in all a very disappointing experience. The best part of the meal was the apricot old fashioned, it is the only thing I would recommend and probably would had had another had the server ever come back and asked if would like another drink."
Kitchen W8,1,12-Jan-23,3,"I wouldn't recommend Kitchen W8.

The Good...

- The servers were friendly. Seemed like really nice people and you could see how they interacted with the other guests. It was really charming.

- The decor. Loved it. Enjoyed the tables, chairs, colors, wall art... All great.

The Bad...

- The food just wasn't great. It was presented beautifully. Some of the most beautifully presented food I've ever experienced. The flavors weren't there. They lacked. It felt like there was much more emphasis on presentation than flavor.

The Ugly...

- I'm shocked this restaurant has a Michelin star. That was the reason we chose Kitchen W8. We went out of our way to visit, and we honestly left disappointed.

- Very overpriced."
Kitchen W8,1,12-Jul-22,5,"One of the best meals I have ever had in my entire life. I didn't even know the menu going in, just that it would be good, and it absolutely blew me away. The highlight of my vacation."
Kitchen W8,1,6-May-22,5,"I wanted to try a Michelin starred restaurant for my 30th birthday and after hours of research, we finally settled on Kitchen W8 and let me tell you, it did NOT disappoint. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a friendly host who handed me a happy birthday card! We got to the table and the server walked us through the menu. We asked a lot of questions and he was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in providing us direction, recommendations and wine pairings. It was a truly memorable experience with impeccable food, delicious drinks, phenomenal service and a clean, modern and classy ambience. Also, they brought me a birthday dessert with a candle. It was such a special meal and I'm so glad I chose to spend my 30th here."
La Trompette,1,5-Jul-24,5,"Great food, great drinks, great service. Delightful neighborhood feel for such high end food"
Locanda Locatelli,1,10-Jun-23,5,Fantastic food and service. A must dining spot in London for high quality Italian food. Ambiance is perfect for that special night out or for a business meal.
Locanda Locatelli,1,14-Apr-23,3,"Service is very professional but not so friendly. Shout out to the wine guy, he was super nice! Food is amazing, has a solid selection of meals. Atmosphere is really boring, no decorations."
Locanda Locatelli,1,16-Mar-23,1,Sadly to report. I used to come to this restaurant often but the management have become vitriolic and rude. I brought a VIP client here and we were shocked to have our food and drink removed. No apology and no communication from the staff. Needless to say my client was disappointed. This is NOT a good place to bring important clients.
Locanda Locatelli,1,12-Oct-22,5,"After a ten year hiatus we finally made it a back this summer. The somme recommended a great amarone (quintarelli 2012) which we thoroughly enjoyed. We started with the vitello tonnato and calamari which were nice and then had the agnello and tagliata which were both really nice. And we finished with a souffle which was great. Overall, it's hard to get in and worth the wait"
Lyle's,1,25-Jun-24,5,"I've been to Lyle's twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Both experiences were excellent. The food was delicious, and the waiting staff was very helpful and seemed genuinely happy, which is uncommon in many restaurants."
Lyle's,1,14-Jun-24,5,"One the finest meals in one of the least pretentious settings I've ever experienced. Every course was a miracle of preparation and presentation. And our server was warm and attentive without being even slightly overbearing. The desserts were transcendent!

A truly special experience that I hope to repeat."
Lyle's,1,16-May-24,5,"We made a reservation here for our Anniversary on the last leg of our trip to Europe. This restaurant was my favorite not only because the food was delicious but also because the service and wait staff were phenomenal. Our waiter, Steph was extremely attentive and made our dining experience extra special on more than one occasion. Different staff members greeted us, served us our meal, and made the entire experience a joy. We were given a signed card and a special dessert that was incredible. I will be adding this to my list next time we visit London. This is my kind of Michelin restaurant, everything from the decor to the casual dining experience. Every dish from the tasting menu was so delicious, I'm still thinking about it."
Lyle's,1,20-Jan-24,5,"This place far exceeded expectations. The food was phenomenal, service was incredibly personal and detail-oriented, and the atmosphere was quite lovely albeit different than expected. Allergens/dietary restrictions were accommodated beautifully.

I will remember the pheasant broth as one of the best things I have ever tasted. I'm not particularly partial to oysters, but these were fabulous. I walked away trusting the chef with my life. Bravo, great experience!"
Lyle's,1,13-Jan-24,5,Their oysters are to die for. They add watermelon juice on top of the oysters and omg! Wow!!!
Lyle's,1,12-Jun-23,4,"home to the micro-seasonal, modern British cooking of chef James Lowe. With a short tasting menu at dinner and à la carte options at lunch, Lyle's explores British delights like green asparagus with nettle and egg yolk in spring, or duck breast with preserved wild mulberries in autumn. Everything is served in a spacious, light-filled dining room in the historic Tea Building, once a Lipton factory, in the foodie-favourite neighbourhood of Shoreditch."
Lyle's,1,10-May-23,5,"A trendy delicious restaurant in a trendy part of London. The service was great and the food was outstanding. The serving sizes are a bit larger than I'm used to for tasting menus, but not complaining--just an observation. This is definitely worth a try on your visit."
Lyle's,1,4-May-23,2,"Was able to snag a last minute reso.

Service was slow and the food was pretty bland.

Started w/ scallops, which made my tummy turn. At first really enjoyed the grapefruit citrus pairing, but there was something in the seasoning that did not sit well w/ my stomach.

Asparagus might've been the most overpriced vegetable I've ever ordered. Normally I'm a fan of anything w/ an egg accompaniment, but yet again, something was off w/ it. The only good part was using the bread to absorb the sauce aftermath.

The highlight was the eel - much to my surprise. And the beet accompaniment was such an interesting contrast. I'd order it again for sure.

Same w/ the pork belly. Prepared very differently from what I'm used to and I enjoyed how thinly sliced it was.

They should extend their lunch hours to start at 11 or 11:30 at the latest to stagger the people more. It was pretty obvious how busy and overwhelmed both the FOH & BOH got. The pacing of the food was so awkward and I felt like we were always waiting for something."
Lyle's,1,7-Apr-23,1,Don't go here. Awful staff and poor management. Million great places in London do not waste your time here
Lyle's,1,29-Mar-23,5,"This is my very favorite kind of Michelin restaurant, where not only is the food spectacular, but the service is top-notch and the staff is FUN! Lyle's has been on my to-do list for a while, and I'm glad I finally made it this visit. I highly recommend the wine pairing, as the wines are carefully selected and really enhance the dishes. My favorite courses were actually the starters....especially the veggie one they made to substitute for the Red Mullet one (I can't eat fin fish). It was delish! The only course that didn't really work for me was the dessert, but that' s not surprising, as I generally am not a fan of sweets. Thanks for a lovely evening!"
Lyle's,1,27-Jan-23,4,"It was good but I had huge expectations and it did not work for me as much as I hoped. I had the luck to go to Brat and Clove Club the same week, and while the presentation was comparable or better, the meal did not come together in the same way. I did not care for the oysters as the Mandaran overpowered the oysters. I found the whelk excellent, probably the highlight. I also thought the turbot was very good. While I enjoyed the mallard and it was presented beautifully, it didn't work for me perfectly. Service was efficient but not as warm as comparable restaurants."
Lyle's,1,17-Oct-22,5,"This was an incredible meal. I got the wine pairing with the dinner tasting menu, and since it changes seasonally and I didn't take notes, I am not going to write details about the food. What I will say is that all the dishes were balanced and complex in the flavors and textures. There were a couple of standouts for me, like a cucumber dish and a mushroom mousse. The wines also definitely augmented the dishes."
Lyle's,1,10-Jul-22,5,"Go for lunch, when you can order a la carte, and the beautiful London summer sun shines into their airy dining room. Razor clams are superb. Their bread is fantastic."
Lyle's,1,10-Jul-22,5,"Incredible. One of my favorite meals from our recent week-long trip to London. The menu and the pictures didn't jump out at me beforehand, but my wife insisted we go and I'm so glad we did.

We went for lunch so we had the a la carte menu, and got two oysters, gazpacho, razor clams, raw scallop, borlotti beans, pork (""Gloucester Old Spot""), ricotta ice cream, and cheeses with honeycomb. Every single bite was excellent, with the gazpacho, scallops, and beans standing out to me, along with their incredible sourdough bread and butter to start. If there's one dish I'll be dreaming of, it'll be the borlotti beans, which were cooked so perfectly and came in an amazing broth.

We'll definitely be back -- maybe for dinner, but I actually like being able to choose what we order for lunch."
Lyle's,1,9-Jul-22,5,"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a world class experience. Definitely understand how this restaurant is listed as #33 on the World's Top 50 restaurants along with a Michelin 1 star.

Made a reservation a couple months in advance and my table was ready upon arrival. Despite the Michelin star, the restaurant was very casual with many wearing trainers and t-shirts.

Lyle's featured a prix fixe meal nightly with the only option being a supplementary cheese course.

Started off the meal with the complimentary sourdough bread with butter that tasted even better as it melted. :) The snack course with the raw oyster and cucumbers were quite unique mixing of different textures and flavors.

The soup course was a light and refreshing course featuring tomato gazpacho along with some very fragrant melons and herbs. Portion was quite generous.

Highlights of the meal included the monkfish course of the evening. The monkfish had a firmer and sweeter texture (similar to lobster) and was cooked to perfection topped with cured mangalits. The peas that complemented this dish were super sweet and extremely flavorful.

The mutton course was also world class with a couple pieces of mutton. Mutton is a touch firmer and tougher than lamb. The mutton was cooked to a perfect rare. The borlotti beans and courgettes were the complements to this course which I didn't quite understand...

The sheep's milk ice cream was also world class as it was non-sweet, even perhaps a touch bitter. The loganberries & oats definitely sweetened this course perfectly.

The last two items from the bakery were mind-boggling. First was a flaky pastry, like a profiterole with some type of custard on the inside, which was phenomenal. The last one was a pound cake with a ton of butter which was also world class. ...the last two items were a memorable way to end off this world class dinner.

~£100/ person for dinner after GST & service."
Lyle's,1,11-Feb-22,5,"Lovely all around. Very helpful, pleasant and attentive staff.

The food was mostly excellent. The oysters and fried mussels were perfect and definitely hot favourites. The Pollack with brown butter sauce was a little below average, but by no means terrible.

The most impressive part was the great atmosphere. The place was packed, but the music was kept at a good level meaning you had no problems chatting with people at your table.

Would definitely go again."
Murano,1,4-Jun-23,5,"Murano just nails it every time. Great team, nice atmosphere, excellent food. Really you cannot go wrong. The choose your own adventure on the courses: 3,4,5 or 6 is perfect and lets people decide how much food and variety they want. The somme's are super knowledgeable and it is our go to in London."
Murano,1,14-Nov-22,3,"The service was definitely confusing. One of our servers seemed to be a trainee and she probably could have used a bit more supervision. The food was good but, I think I expected more. The squid ink pasta was amazing but the fish main just didn't sit well with me. The lunch set menu really is quite the value and I will definitely be going back."
Murano,1,8-Oct-22,3,Service was confusing. Food was good but not one star. It's more eclectic than Italian.
Murano,1,30-Aug-22,4,"Great food, impeccable service - not much atmosphere. The silence is deafening. Ideal setting for a group of foodies who are determined to find some of the best northern Italian cuisine in London."
Murano,1,2-Jul-22,5,"Great spot just off Kurzon Street, formerly a Gordon Ramsay restaurant but now it is much much better! Dinner is delicious but I think lunch is the best value they have several menus to choose from with numerous courses, we selected the simple lunch menu and it was ample for our hungry group. Started off with delicious bread, shaved Serano ham, olives and some Parmesan churros, all complementary. Next I had the grilled asparagus deliciously interesting and pollock, a light flaky fish similar to cod. Dessert was a wonderful raspberry tart with crème fraîche. Wine was a fairly reasonable Austrian Gruner Veltliner, delicious!
:-)"
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,18-Jul-24,5,"Whining and negative reviews here are incredulous and show incompetence. The moment we entered last night, to the time of departure we were whisked away on an impeccable service and culinary journey fit for royalty. Most of the world's esteemed, celebrated chefs have gone corporate, and have lost control of the quality and service you come to expect from a Michelin star establishment but not chef Ramsay at Petrus. The staff in the front and back of the house are trained at the highest level. In closing the pictures speak for themselves. Photography is clearly not a strength of mine but the pictures tell the story."
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,25-May-24,5,"I cannot say enough wonderful things about Petrus. This was definitely an experience to be had if you are visiting London. The service is impeccable and the staff wonderful and amazing. The food was both creative and delicious with attention to details as well as top notch presentation. All fresh ingredients that compliments each other to create memorable one of a kind dishes. 10 out of 10, highly recommend."
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,23-May-24,5,"Wow! This has to be the best dining experience I have ever had. I've been to a few fine dining experiences not many but the service here was out this world!
The attention to detail, the knowledge of the food and drinks, water was never empty, service super nice.
Not to mention the have a menu for every diet there is.
My husband is vegetarian and I'm pescatarian they brought us out two different menus to choose from. The food came out timely and amazing!
I loved every moment at this restaurant."
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,24-Mar-24,5,"Last night at Petrus by Gordon Ramsay was an incredible experience from start to finish. Each dish had unique flavor profiles that impressed us, like the smoked eel with its initial smokiness that gave way to other ingredients as we ate through it. I now understand better how the ingredients work together to help create a harmonious meal. We had a reservation at 9pm and didn't leave until midnight. The environment was very high class being a Michelin starred restaurant with very reserved lighting and waiters who would come to top off your drinks whenever they got low. What a great experience..."
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,7-Mar-24,2,not great everyone spoke French im English not happy want a refund u have no sympathy for the English people
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,22-Nov-23,1,"Horrible service, mediocre food but decent ambiance. We went here to celebrate an engagement and once seated, the server asks us if we want a complimentary champagne which we declined. I informed her we drink red wine and asked to see the wine list. She mentions it's 70 pages on an iPad and she can recommend a few. We took a look at the list and scrolled to the red wine section and chose a Bordeaux. She comes back and opens a bottle of white wine Bordeaux and once I informed her it was supposed to be the red, she leaves to tell a manger and comes back stating she told me ""various"" times it was white. Both me and my fiancé told her we declined the champagne because we don't drink white so why would we choose a white wine when I specifically asked her for the list of reds. At no time did she say it was a white wine and so the manager comes over and defends her saying he's worked with her for years and she would not lie. So basically I was the liar and they wanted to charge me for the bottle. He then says he wants everyone to enjoy the night and would replace with the Bordeaux red which made sense as to why she would confuse the 2 because he states there is a red and white of the same wine. It was too late, the night was ruined and as the dishes came out, I was less and less impressed. The best dish was the venison but everything else was tasteless food masked with a sauce. Very salty and for it to be a Michelin star restaurant, I was extremely disappointed. To top it off, they bring the check over and it's completely wrong and had to be corrected by the manager for items we did not even order. Do yourself a favor and spend the money on somewhere that is not so overrated."
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,27-Aug-23,3,"I have been coming to Petrus for as long as I can remember - from when it was the hot new restaurant in town on St. James's. While it has not been the hot new restaurant nor has it been on St. James's for some time, Petrus has remained a favorite. Unfortunately I cannot say that anymore. Nothing is bad and the service is still impeccable, but the food is bland and not particularly unique. It is simply an expensive restaurant living off its reputation. Gordon needs to do a Hell's Kitchen reboot to get it back to its former glory. It would be truly sad to see it simply whither away like so many other classic dining establishments."
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,20-Aug-23,4,"We had a lovely dinner there the other night. This is a great location and the team are very knowledgeable and professional. We did the prestige tasting menu with wine pairings. The somm did a great job and engaged us explaining the wines and chit chatting. Unlike some wine pairings when they get a little out there, they stayed in the fairway but took a few chances (an interesting red from the canary islands).

Sadly by the time we got to the chocolate dessert, we were pretty full (we did opt for cheese). The cheese plate was probably the highlight of the meal with a great selection of goat (ash), creamy (brillat savarin), hard (comte), soft (cannot recall the name) and blue. The brown bread was nice. I do wish more restaurants would provide some plain bagette with cheese but this cheese was so good we really didnt need bread or crackers.

The rest of the meal was lovely--tomato tart, scallops, cod and lamb. The scallops probably had a touch too much lemon in them (The gel and the foam) and the peas with the lamb were pretty minty. I'm nitpicking of course and for some, these meals are all about the right balance of flavors.

Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,7-Aug-23,5,"Just had the most incredible culinary experience at Petrus in London! We were lucky enough to snag a spot at the chef's table, right in the heart of the kitchen. Watching the talented chefs create not only the meals for the main dining room but also crafting unique and decadent dishes just for us was mind-blowing.

I never knew such a culinary journey existed until now. The service was top-notch, a solid 100! The atmosphere, with the hustle and bustle of the kitchen, added an extra layer of excitement to the whole experience.

Each dish was a work of art, meticulously handmade and presented to our table. The chefs took the time to explain every element, making us feel like true connoisseurs. It was a feast for the senses, with flavors and textures that I never thought possible.

If you're a food lover like me, Petrus is an absolute must-visit. Prepare to be amazed and taken on a gastronomic adventure like no other. Trust me, you won't regret it!"
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,30-Jul-23,5,"Top 3 in my book.this restaurant is deserving of it's one star Michelin ratings.

The place is easy to have a conversation. From double linen tablecloths, carpet and window treatments, it muted the noises. Although our table faced another couple so smile at them, it was elegantly decorated.

Our server, Dua, was very professionally and made our close to three hour dining very enjoyable. The sommelier helped me guide through their wines and decided to do glasses of wine.

We did the prestige tasting menu and did not disappoint! My friend didn't want the lamb and they substituted it for 100 day aged beef. It was a fantastic sub out. Like a fine piece of art work on your plate and everything just paired perfectly with the sauces and veggies with the main stars of the dishes.

So glad we dined here as my fine dining experience in London!
"
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,17-Jun-23,5,A great overall experience. The restaurant only has a few tables so the overall service was great as a result!
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,21-May-23,2,"I had the most disappointing experience in any restaurant here. Let me preface my 2 stars by saying that our wait staff and sommelier were fantastic as was the food. My issue was their dishonesty. I booked the chefs table on open table using the ""Experience"" tab, where it describes the dining experience as being in the kitchen at a specific cost. After traveling from the United States with friends we were all totally excited. Imagine our distress when we found out we were being seated elsewhere. Not a huge deal as we still had dinner, but how they handled it was deplorable. Their manager tried to convince me that I had not booked it, going on and on about procedures that THEY have in place that had not happened - none of which a customer would know even existed and were not shown during booking Apparently it requires prepayment (I did enter my credit card when I booked). They even called to confirm during which time they offered two menu options with two prices, I mentioned my confusion at the options and discussed how the chefs table had only 1 price option. At that point I had booked the table, now I believed it was confirmed due to that call. We do get a visit (1 minute to placate me) to the kitchen and I wasn't at all surprised to see a full table of 8 dining at the kitchen table, at least I know why we were bumped Clearly 8 spend more than 4. To add insult to injury they called me to try again to convince me it was my mistake. Oh and offer me a bottle of champagne on my next trip in. Hello I live in the US!!! I will not be back there to eat again"
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,25-Apr-23,5,"Petrus is our favorite Gordon Ramsey restaurant. We've been here several times and the food, service and ambiance are incredible and consistent. There are a few options when dining here for dinner from a la carte 3 course to 7 courses. I would suggest trying lunch for a fist visit. Lunch provides a good fixed 3 course sampling of what the restaurant offers at a more reasonable price point than dinner. If you like Lunch (and you will) come back for dinner. We tried the 5 course Prestige Menu for dinner and it did not disappoint. You can tell a lot of work goes into food preparation. The theme for our meal was ""Spring"" and every dish had something floral highlighted. From the edible flowers in the Organic Spelt Ragout first course to the Ice Cream sculpted tulip for dessert. A big shout out to Danny who help with wine selections which paired perfectly and complemented my Scallops (Chablis Grand Cru) and the 100 Days Aged Cumbrian Blue Grey (Clos du Marquis). Each dish is small, but by the end of all the courses you are sufficiently full and satisfied. You can tell there's a huge amount of thought, effort, dedication and pride that goes into creating and presenting the meal and it really is a form of art. If you have an allergy to some ingredients on the menu, the chef will completely make something just for you, as they did with my sister-in-law. Also note jackets are not required. Although nice classy dress for this level of restaurant feels better for me, there were folks there wearing jeans and a sweatshirt. Give Petrus a try. You won't be disappointed."
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,25-Apr-23,5,"5 stars for the amazing service we received. First, I want to point out that we had originally made dinner reservations here the first night we'd be in town. What we didn't account for was potential delays in both flights and traffic! So we were almost very late to this reservation. We didn't even get to change from our flight clothes into more appropriate clothes for the tasting.

I dined at Petrus in yoga pants, a hoodie and sneakers. No make up. To put it simply. In 100% full American fashion.

We also came trudging along with our suitcases! The staff was kind enough to hold those for us and seat us. If they were judging us, we couldn't tell.

Everything we ate was memorable. Most dishes included a pouring of some type of sauce or soup. Which I thought was interesting. We were stuffed by the end of it. It was a ton of food that we had to take the Madeline's to go!

Everyone present was dressed for the occasion and May or may not have been enjoying a date. I felt very happy that this was our first experience in England!"
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,28-Mar-23,1,"Poor customer service and communication. My underage son made a reservation here without knowing the price range. A few hours later, I reviewed his dinner recommend and saw the price range and menu and called to cancel. Whomever answered the phone cancelled the reservation no problem, but didn't tell me it would be a 120p per person cancellation charge! I called back and spoke with the Manager and she was unable to refund the 240p charged on my son's card. She mentioned that we could come in and eat an a la cart menu. I don't think she understood the mistake that we could not afford a meal of this price, or that someone should have mentioned that we would be charged when I called to cancel.
Not a great experience!"
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,23-Mar-23,5,Good food and friendly service. Very accommodating of food allergies and special diets. Just as I expected from a Michelin starred restaurant and actually better than some that I've been to. But there are some diners who had loud conversations in the nearby table that was quite annoying (because I can literally hear everything they said and I didn't even intend or enjoy hearing) but that's just luck and it cannot be helped. Otherwise the ambience is nice and relaxing for people to enjoy their dinner.
Pétrus by Gordon Ramsay,1,21-Mar-23,5,"Gordon Ramsay's 1 Michelin named after the famous wine. Had the lunch menu and it was great (also aesthetically pleasing). The cured salmon went really well with the tapioca and the devon ray wing was cooked perfectly. Service was great, as expected."
Pied à Terre,1,24-Sep-23,5,"This was one of the best dining experiences of my life!! We ordered the eight course tasting menu along with the wine pairings. Everything was outstanding. The attention to even the smallest details was incredible. There really aren't enough superlatives to describe the inventive, yet delicious meal we enjoyed. We will definitely be returning!"
Pied à Terre,1,3-Jun-23,5,"I went here for a friend's birthday. We did ten courses and a five courses of wine. I was impressed with the vegan menu. Great presentation of food, which was also very delicious."
Pied à Terre,1,28-Apr-23,5,"Wow! Thank you for making our night rather special. Efficiently organised by Ciara in the private dining room with a decadent space to celebrate. Paulo was wonderful describing the dishes and our sommelier paired each with a delightful, unusual choice where he explained how his choice enhanced the food. The wonderful banter between the two demonstrated the teamwork and passion at Pied a Terre. Thank you for putting up with our speeches, raucous appreciation and the longest goodbye ever. We will remember less as a result of the 'smokey Grappa!'. Xx"
Pied à Terre,1,25-Apr-23,5,"Always a required stop in London. There's a reason this restaurant has been in business more than thirty years.

Our favorite aspect is that they will give you a blind wine paring, so if you're into wine it is really fun to guess with no preconceived notions. Great service and hospitality."
Pied à Terre,1,15-Apr-23,5,Exquisite meal! Food was delicious- especially the rhubarb Yorkshire pudding and peanut butter crisp dessert. Great ambience and outstanding service. I will be sure to reserve a table every trip I make to London!
Pied à Terre,1,19-Mar-23,5,"my first Michelin restaurant in London and it did not disappoint (this place is also London's longest standing Michelin restaurant). better than most 1 star restaurants in the DC area. the 10 course Greek/French inspired dinner was creative and delicious. staff was amazing as well. highlights were the cauliflower, turbot, egg kayianna, Yorkshire rhubarb, and honey ice cream with honeycomb. also their old fashioned in f'ing delicious.
"
Pied à Terre,1,9-Sep-22,5,"Best meal of my life. Best service I've ever had, especially from Paolo and Keiron. A truly remarkable birthday vegan dining experience."
Pied à Terre,1,16-Aug-22,3,"Pied à Terre serves beautiful -- but overpriced -- bites in a gorgeous space. We came while they were serving a special 30th anniversary set lunch; our favorites were the foie gras / truffle / croissant and cornish turbot with rose harissa. Overall, good food; just not super memorable.

Dined: August 20, 2021"
Pied à Terre,1,25-Jun-22,5,Service and food were superb. The food was creative and delicious the service was engaging and attentive Thank you for a great experience
Pied à Terre,1,6-May-22,3,"Mr & I came here for our first evening in London. Ordered the 10 course vegetarian tasting menu with wine pairing. The staff was friendly & jovial throughout the evening. Dishes were mostly hits with a few misses & same with the wine pairings Service started out overly attentive but by the end of the meal we were basically ignored

Each dish is probably a few bites but they all add up so you won't leave hungry

I liked how they offered wines from locations that were not considered ""standard"" like tasting from Greece that had strong tones of bay leaves

Dress code seemed all over the place with diners wearing faded tshirts, jeans & trainers to people wearing tracksuits (yes, really) to people wearing suits and ties so my advice would be to wear what makes you happy & enjoy your night out

Total rundown:
3 hours, 2 people
10 courses with 7 pairings

Pollen Street Social,1,4-Apr-24,5,amazing service and good interactive staff we met the chef best experience that I've had went above and beyond an amazing introduction to Michelin dining
Pollen Street Social,1,6-Oct-23,5,"Simple chic and intimate dining experience. Perfect service and beautiful food. The wine Stewart almost upsold me a bottle of French white but I know French wines extremely well, so I declined. He wasn't offended. And I didn't take offence. All in all, perfect lunch."
Pollen Street Social,1,28-Aug-23,5,"We had a wonderful dinner and experience with our two guests (from the US) who we were meeting for the first time ""in the flesh"" and also needed to discuss some possible business collaborations and se we much appreciated two things - the quiet, welcoming atmosphere and the fact that we were not rushed in any way - even though we spent 3 hours together at the table. We all have different things from the menu and everyone truly enjoyed what they were served (starters, fish dishes and desserts) - and commenting on it. I guess a Michelin star really does mean something!

Usually I take pictures of the food but it was business - so not this time. Do try it yourselves folks - highly recommended!!"
Pollen Street Social,1,18-Mar-23,5,"The food and wine pairings were spectacular. The staff was the perfect combination of warmth and professionalism. The ambiance was modern, fresh and bright."
Pollen Street Social,1,17-Feb-23,5,A polished excellent restaurant - second time and just as good as the first! The 4 course menu felt good value.
Pollen Street Social,1,2-Jan-23,5,"We had a perfect meal at Pollen Street, including the beef, fish entrees and the starters, the onion tart and langoustine. We had a very nice chocolate dessert. Service was excellent. Prices were fair and worth every pense."
Pollen Street Social,1,4-Mar-22,1,They had problem with out reservation so rather than figuring out if we can be seated they went into a meltdown over their reservation system. To call the manager an a/hole is an insult to a-holes. Would rather eat dog food than go back. Luckily went to my hotel claridges where they understand how to do proper service
Quilon,1,13-Jun-24,5,"As an American, indulging in a Michelin star dinner focusing on regional cuisine of Kerela was a treat to remember. Upon entering the restaurant you feel like an upscale experience awaits. The only quibble was the 'standard Indian classical music' which is not everyone's taste. We had the seafood tasting menu (everyone had to order the same menu) which was a culinary delight. Cocktails were excellent - Laventini and the Botanical Garden were delicious. We also had two wines, a GAVI and a Peccorino, which paired well. The food was a tour de force through the various spices, curries and textures of Kerala seafood cuisine. I would recommend the tasting menu again since it runs you through the best of the best and was well portioned to leave you feeling full. I'll call out the 3rd course, black cod, which was out of this world in terms of flavor, texture and moisture. The lobster items were delicate and allowed the ingredient to shine. The service was attentive and timely, though a number of times we were asked for drinks or water after a wait staff had already asked. Was it a Michelin star experience? Yes."
Quilon,1,6-Jun-24,5,"Great tastes, incredible service. Highly recommend the vegetarian dishes. I'll be back"
Quilon,1,5-May-24,5,"What a great and unexpected Sunday Brunch. Unlike any we have ever had before.

Highly recommended and we will come back next time we are in London"
Quilon,1,26-Apr-24,5,"The food was amazing! Everything we had was incredible special call out to the chili fried cauliflower , the okra and the black cod. The pistachio cake with pistachio ice cream was divine."""

Quilon,1,29-Mar-24,4,"I and a group of friends had a great time at this restaurant. The food was tasty with good flavor, the atmosphere was warm and friendly and the service was excellent."
Quilon,1,14-Mar-24,5,"Totally fabulous dining experience. We went for a team lunch and did their fixed menu. Every single item was AMAZING.
The halibut appetizer was flaky and beautiful. The mango curry was one of the best curries I've ever tasted in my life. Each dish was beautifully presented and carefully prepared to deliver each flavor perfectly. The staff was so accommodating and their attention to detail for our gluten free diner was impeccable."
Quilon,1,28-Nov-23,5,Food was outstanding and different than other Indian restaurants much more complex flavors not so in your face flavor profiles. Nice list of tap wines and Service was perfect
Quilon,1,14-Sep-23,5,"I wanted Indian cuisine and my 79 year old mother had never had Indian food, ever! We absolutely loved everything we had. I'm afraid Quilon has set the bar very high for her next Indian food. Haha.

Amazing service, amazing food, great location and atmosphere. Everything we ate was simply incredible. I especially loved the Fisherman's Catch starter and the Chi Tea. The Chicken Pepper Masala, Lemon Rice, and paratha were so very good. If I didn't live in the USA I'd come here often. If in London, eat here! It's absolutely worth it."
Quilon,1,20-Aug-23,5,"This is one of the best Indian restaurants I have ever been to. I was in London for business and my coworker booked a table at this wonderful establishment specializing in home-style South-West coastal Indian Cuisin.
It was such a wonderful culinary experience that my mouth salivates just at the thought of the scrumptious meal we had.
Quilon more than deserves its Michelin Star: the service was impeccable, the ambiance classy and welcoming at the same time and the food was such a special treat that I can't wait to be back."
Quilon,1,28-Jul-23,5,"Hands down, one of the most authentic, high end South Indian Restaurants in London!!! Authentic south India flavors (note - I am from Kerala!!) - esp love the Lamb Biryani, the Prawn Masala, and the Mangalorean Chicken with Kerala Parotta! From an appetizer perspective, I highly recommend the Lamb Kothu and also the Fish platter! The Mango Margarita is legit and no one can stop with one!!!! The staff was super friendly and the ambiance calm and classy - as expected from a Taj Group establishment."
Quilon,1,21-Jul-23,5,"We enjoyed our dinner at Quilon. The staff were friendly and attentive. The food was delcious. We ordered the Broccoli & Spinach Galette, the Mini Masal Dosa, the Lobster broth, the Prawn masala, the Chickpea masala, Baked Black Cod, Lemon Jasmine Rice and Malabar Paratha. We ordered many items to sample as a family. The lemon jasmine rice was our least favorite but was recommended by our waitress. We saved room for dessert and enjoyed the Pistachio Cake, the Chocolate Date Torte and the Bibnica. The pistachio cake was our favorite. For a quality Indian meal, look no further than Quilon."
Quilon,1,20-Jul-23,5,"""Wonderful staff and superb food for a special occasion. Amazing seafood. Don't miss the malabar paratha either!"
Quilon,1,16-Jun-23,5,My family doesn't have a lot of experience with Indian food. This was a wonderful first experience. We ordered a la Carte so we could share and every dish was amazing. Highly recommend the lamb shank. Desserts were also fantastic.
Quilon,1,8-Apr-23,5,We tried the tasting menu with 13 courses for 2 with wine tasting which was a little too much for two people but the food was so delicious. I would say this is not really Indian food but more of fusion influenced by it. They were also very generous with their wine pour as well. Service is also top notch. It definitely deserves the Michelin star!!!
Quilon,1,18-Feb-23,4,This place was recommended by the hotel staff and there's not really any dress code. Very easy to get a table on a Saturday night.
Ritz Restaurant,1,30-May-24,4,"I was doing some work in bromley by bow and a friend said there a restaurant which can put some fire in your heart, I thought being a tourist this could be a fabulous London experience. I could only thank the restaurant for my bracing the food culture. Being from Netherlands I had heard many rumors about good food spots. So it was good to find this it was very different from the ritz in Dubai just a bit of food history"
Ritz Restaurant,1,17-Jun-23,5,"This was the most glamorous, beautiful restaurant I've ever been to and it made for a very memorable 30th birthday for my sister. The food at the high tea was exquisite! The pastries were each handmade and must've taken hours to make. The little sandwiches were simple but delicious. The band played Christmas music and played happy birthday for my sister which was a ton of fun.

The service was wonderful and the room was the prettiest room imaginable!"
Ritz Restaurant,1,15-Jun-23,5,"This place was no doubt the nicest restaurant for high tea. Walking in, two men in fancy suits greeted me at the door. Me and my two kids dressed up; and were glad we did. Everyone was wearing gowns due to the dress-code; men in coats and ties and in general dress smart. Everything was breathtaking; flowers, plants, and all the architectural design was impressive. We were then escorted to our seats, and not soon after, ordered our tea. The service was spectacular. All the men wore fancy suits with tails. Our personal favorites from tea included the Lemon Verbena, Classic Chai and the Passion fruit and Orange (all amazing). They gave us multiple refills on sandwiches and pastries, and when we got a to-go box, they gave us extras. The ladies restroom known there as the powder room was beautiful. Lily pads, flowers and plants made up the wallpaper. All the sinks were pink marble, and there was a literal hot pink sofa and chairs scattered about. I have nothing bad to say about The Ritz. It was a perfect, gorgeous dining experience."
Ritz Restaurant,1,20-May-23,4,"We went for afternoon tea. I made reservations a month ahead of the date. They get booked fast, so don't wait.
We arrived and were greeted at the door by the doorman. We walked in to a beautiful hotel. The tea room is also very beautiful.
We left our coats at the coat room and were seated immediately for our 5:30 tea time. We ended up getting the champagne tea. So, you start with a glass of champagne prior to your tea. Everything is done quickly. Before you know it, you have your sandwiches and tea at your table. The presentation was beautiful.

Sandwiches: my favorite was the egg sandwich, but all of them were good. Everything, except the champagne, is all you can eat or drink, but we couldn't even finish what they served us the first round. All the sandwiches come on different breads. All good on their own way. My second and third favorites were the salmon and cheese and chutney. They also bring out a cucumber sandwich, ham and chicken sandwich.

Pastries: they were all delicious, but my favorite was the passion fruit one. There was one lemon meringue one and a type of stuffed banana bread one.
If you're from the US, the scones are not what you expect. They are biscuits. They have a good flavor. A little dense.

Tea: you have to finish your pot before ordering a new one. Since there were three of us in our party, we were able to taste several ones. We all agreed that the earl grey was the best from the four we got. We also tried the Moroccan mint, Rose congou, Passion fruit and orange

My birthday was the week of my visit and they surprised me with a birthday dessert. That was super nice of them.

The staff was great. Very proper. The only hiccup we encountered was when we were leaving. We were taking a selfie and the door man told a driver standing next to him that Americans thought everything was special. He was pretty loud about it and since we were the only ones around, we thought he directed it to us. We decided to brush it off and continue our london adventures.




"
Ritz Restaurant,1,10-Apr-23,3,"the view, the service, Great

The menu? Underwhelming.

We had a mexican menu flautas, mole verd, etc. i got the mole Verde with Shrimp. Was good but it lacked flavor. I had a major oopsie In my plate but that's non the less it happens. What made me write a review is the i felt the menu was kind of disrespectful to Mexican food. I'm from Mexico but i can enjoy a hole in the wall as much as a Ritz hotel. But the reason i think is disrespectful is the lack of flavor and total misrepresentation of the food. The ritz is a place where many cultures of mid to high class go too. And to have the food taste like it came from an Olive Garden seemed crazy to me.

The burger? bomb the Salmon Bomb. But all the Mexican food was...not good. The flautas, which are supposed to be crunchy, looked and tasted like crepes. Weird. the red salsa tasted like the and mole verde. weird.

I've tasted classy mexican food and most of the time it's great maybe less spicy but great nonetheless. The chef needs to stop experimenting so much. Cool mexican food with a little of your flavor dont completely reinvent it."
Ritz Restaurant,1,21-Oct-22,5,"The Ritz London afternoon tea has a strong reputation for a reason. They were seamless in their service and they treated my mother like a Queen which is a huge mark in their favor.

Everyone there was so friendly and quick with a little joke, not at all like the stuffy pomp and circumstance I had expected. The staff was warm and extremely attentive.

We had the normal afternoon tea service and we each ordered a different tea. The staff knew exactly which tea we ordered and when it came time for a refill they didn't need to ask us. It was impressive to say the least.

The sandwiches were delicious and the bread they use is soft and they choose different types to compliment the filling. My favorites were the chicken curry and the egg salad.

The desserts were the perfect size and so tasty! My favorite was the mango mousse.

We forgot to take a picture of the scones with clotted cream and preserves but they were delicious and fluffy inside. Perfect texture for spreading the clotted cream, which tasted so fresh and light.

I suggest you come hungry because the staff will keep refilling your plates until you say stop!

The Pianist is incredible! Ian Gomes is a legend that used to accompany the likes of Frank Sinatra! He kept whispering to us asking for requests and he was so sweet. He took a break and came down and greeted us. His fingers really make magic on that instrument and it really makes the whole experience that much more special.

High marks to the staff!
I appreciated how kind, attentive and warm they were to my family. People save their hard earned money to have special experiences like this and this staff really made it memorable. Thank you so much! We will definitely be coming back."
Ritz Restaurant,1,11-Sep-22,1,"This was such a joke, the Ritz is totally using their reputation to charge way too much for high tea that is nothing special. The tea was good, but that was the extent of what I really liked. The sandwiches were bland, the scones were overcooked, and one of the desserts was so bad I spit it out. Not only that, but there was NO TOILET PAPER in the bathroom. You know what's not fun, having to waddle to the next stall to get toilet paper not even in a bathroom so fancy its gilded in gold... I'm not sure if it's COVID or the remodeling that is going on, but if you are actually interested in the food and tea at high tea, then go somewhere else.

Oh and the kicker, they charged us the wrong amount and tried to have us pay for 4 drinks we didn't order. Don't fall for this tourist trap."
Ritz Restaurant,1,22-Jul-22,5,"Even though this only has 1 Michelin star, it exemplifies qualities of the 3 Michelin star restaurants I've been to in NYC (Per Se, Eleven Madison, Le Bernardin). Let's start with service and ambiance. From the second you walk into the Ritz Hotel, you'll be completely in awe of the stunning elegance and class. It continues into the restaurant which has tables widely placed apart from each other so I can't hear other people's conversations (big plus!). There is a pianist and a singer performing live which totally adds another level of ""wow this is so friggin awesome!"". The wait staff greets guests by their last names and they all wear long coattails. They place down plates synchronously for everyone at the table. And they lift the food covers up at same time too. That's not something you see often. They are so attentive throughout the entire 3-hour dinner (got the 7-course) without making you feel uncomfortable. They watch you from afar and refill your glasses or bring plates away with the perfect timing.

The food is impeccable!! Everything is so exquisite and makes me wonder how is this only 1 Michelin star?! Everything was cooked to perfection. I didn't like the pheasant since I personally find it a gamey type of poultry. Although I only ate 1 of the 2 pieces of pheasant, watching 3 staff preparing the pheasant and the sauce was very exciting. There was a huge flame as they made the sauce on a skillet, they also used a French press as part of the preparation. It was almost like a mini cooking show lol. The cod and lobster were delectable. Raspberry sorbet was so refreshing for cleansing the palette. The highlight for me was definitely the hazelnut dessert which was like nothing I've ever had before. It was loaded with hazelnut flavor yet it was still well balanced without being overly sweet. I usually don't like a lot of the European restaurants' desserts because they're usually too sweet for me. But this one is to die for, yum!!"
Ritz Restaurant,1,22-Mar-22,4,"The Ritz Restaurant is a beautiful dining experience. The clientele both times we went were older. It's a nice, romantic spot. Great for celebrating special occasions. The langoustine appetizer was so wonderful. The sauces at The Ritz are fabulous. The Cornish Seabass was also divine. The turbo cannot be surpassed. The chocolate soufflé was nice, but the crepe Suzette is the star of show as it is prepared table side.

Men must wear a tie, but don't fret if you did not pack one. The cloak room at The Ritz has a selection of ties to loan for dinner.

The only real downside of the meal is sometimes the live singer is so loud that one cannot hear anyone else at the table. The piano player was flawless both nights we were there and quite beautiful."
River Café,1,23-Jun-24,5,"Oh yes, The River Cafe truly is as amazing as it is unique. The food and atmosphere are simply wonderful. The service is invisible, yet incredible. The food is the star and it is the best. Go, go, go!!"
River Café,1,19-May-24,5,The restaurant is beautiful! The food was very good and service was very pleasant. The pizza was a bit salty but still very tasty. The Dover Sole was the highlight of the meal.
River Café,1,3-Apr-24,5,The food was amazing and the presentation was magnificent. The service was impeccable and spot on. The ambience was very relaxing and lively
River Café,1,14-Jan-24,4,"Last time we were here was almost 20 years ago. We have no recollection of that visit. We knew of this place through their cookbooks.

It is a trek to get here. There is not much to do in the immediate area. You can't actually see the Thames from the restaurant.

We were here at noon on a Sunday. It seemed like there were more staff than guests for the first hour.

The pizzetta was just OK. The calamari had the best looking rocket (aka arugula) we had ever seen. It was a simple and delicious dish. Gnocchi was made with semolina, not our favorite. The scallops were beautifully plated. As for desserts, we wanted tiramisu but it was unavailable, which was weird since the menu was dated for that day. We settled for roasted almond gelati, which was delicious with espresso. We liked the lemon, almond polenta cake but the blood orange was barely caramelized. It was so tart. Visually, the desserts were not complicated nor did they have complex components.

The server was generally nice and attentive. I guess you have to be attractive to be a server here.

Why was there a huge digital clock? We liked it, though. We like to keep track of time and didn't want to overstay our welcome. The decor wasn't the best. The plates were too simple. The chairs looked like office chairs. I guess minimalism and bold colors were the theme.

It is, of course, worth a trek to eat here. They even had their own store nearby.

River Café,1,28-Oct-23,4,Very good still after all these years! Service is attentive without being crowded. Menu pays homage to the classics while being creative on its own merits. Food is consistently good without being outstanding. Good wine list of Italian labels with prices that are not outlandish. Solid performer that meets expectations.
River Café,1,25-Oct-23,5,"Its been too long since we went here. We were determined to really enjoy our meal and the experience; old hands here, true, but we were just in the mood for being pampered, having a wonderful meal and simply relaxing

And so it was; a nice reception outside and the ever wonderful Charles Pullan to take us to our table; a lovely, warm evening, we chose outside. A few minutes in his capable hands and its like you have never been away

You ask and everything just happens around you; no stress all evening...and it became pretty busy. The waitresses are experienced, knowledgeable, professional, yet they too are always relaxed and their attention is on you, they listen, they are not distracted; you barely have to raise an eyebrow and someone is there, yet unobtrusive

We did not stint: bubbles, a decent couple of glasses of wine, prosciutto, carpaccio, monkfish, sirloin, ice cream, affogato, double espresso, 1 dessert wine - it wasn't cheap, but you just have to indulge from time to time...it was the most expensive meal we have had since Rostang in Paris a few years ago, though that was nearly twice as much and half as good...and too starchy

This is just pleasure"
River Café,1,14-Aug-23,5,"The food was of an impressive standard! We were particularly impressed with the veal shin as a main course and the almond tart as a dessert. The wood-fired lobster was perfectly executed and equally delicious. The pasta, however, fell slightly short of expectations. Nevertheless, the rest of the dishes were highly enjoyable and consistently delicious."
River Café,1,2-Jul-23,5,so so good. it was our last meal of the trip and the perfect sendoff. the menu changes daily and the ambiance is perfection. i had pasta with a parmesan sauce and asparagus. the focaccia served before the meal was *chef's kiss.* We split the lemon tart and s gelato for dessert - delish. recommend a beautiful stroll on the water after your meal!
River Café,1,15-Jun-23,3,"An iconic experience, but one that we wish had been flawless. We trekked out here for dinner a couple nights ago, and while the setting was lovely, the service was less so, and it marred our overall experience.

We had their earliest seating at 6:30 but because our waitress was flighty and unengaged, we were there much longer than we wanted to be. Since we weren't starving, we decided to order one dish from each section (OK, we admit we got two desserts). For the antipasti, we started with the mozzarella and caponata...it was incredible and paired perfectly with the complimentary focaccia that they bring out. The cheese was so creamy and it paired wonderfully with the saltiness/brine of the olives. 10/10!

For primi, it was the pappardelle with rabbit, and again, nailed it--except that for some reason our pasta came out lukewarm, and not as hot as the sauce, which was odd and a shame. Even still, the rabbit pieces were generous and the tomato-based sauce was the ideal vehicle for the meat. 9/10! There was a LONG gap--an unnecessarily long gap--between courses when our secondi finally arrived. We ordered the branzino, which was lovely and delicate, and had a healthy amount of greens with it. 8.5/10 (there were a couple small bones that we found; our darling waitress was unimpressed when our daughter told her as much). We have saltier palettes and genuinely appreciate when salt is on the table, thank you!

Dessert was chocolate nemesis, which is absolutely the most decadent flourless chocolate cake that you will ever have, wow. SO rich and good. We didn't love the toasted almond ice cream, however, because the nut chunks were too big and the consistency wasn't very creamy.

While most of the food was 4-5 stars, we're ultimately settling on 3 stars (rounding down from 3.5) because of the service. She was a statuesque woman who was perhaps moonlighting as a waitress, which might explain why she didn't really seem invested in doing a good job. Dishes are expensive--after The Fat Duck, this menu was the steepest in price, so we expected a little bit more attention and care. We will say that we had a lovely meal and a nice time on a beautiful evening with heavenly weather. We're not upset about anything; we just left feeling unfulfilled. Maybe next time, maybe not."
River Café,1,25-Jan-23,4,Beautiful restaurant with terrific servers. I had the linguini al vongole to start. I found it a tad salty and maybe only 5 clams. I followed with a delicious monkfish. I find $100 pounds for lunch rather high. It's my first day visiting. I can't say if the restaurant is expensive or London is
River Café,1,1-Dec-22,5,"On my most recent trip to London, my wife suggested I try the River Cafe. She'd happened upon their podcast and has been a bit obsessed. I happily obliged and made a lunchtime reservation. The restaurant is located just off the River Thames in an industrial building in Hammersmith. The two highlights of my experience were the service and the food. My waiter was incredible. He not only had suggestions of his favorites, but he told me I could order half orders of different things so I could experience more dishes. When describing the dishes, he spoke as if he cooked them himself. His passion for the dishes came through. When asked about wine, he did just as well as any sommelier I've spoken with and provided great recommendations. He totally set the tone for the meal for me. Foodwise, I started with the Granchio, which was a pile of Devon crab meat with Sardinian winter tomato bruschetta, aioli, and a quenelle of crab butter. This dish was briny, sweet, rich yet light...wonderful start to the meal. For my primi, I got a half order of the Agnoli de Viltello (slow cooked veal shin wrapped in little pasta bundles in olive oil and sage) and the spaghetti con vongole e bottarga sardo (clams and shaved bottarga). I ate the agnoli first and as good as the veal filling was, it was the pasta that was the star. Just expertly crafted with a beautiful texture. This dish was super simple, but delicious. I followed with the clam and bottarga pasta. The first few bites after the earthy agnoli were, to be honest, a bit intense. The overpowering flavors of the sea just did not transition well from the veal pasta. However, after my taste buds acclimated, I was able to truly enjoy the creamy pasta with tons of clams and bottarga to the fullest. Briny, fresh, chewy, creamy, salty all came together in harmony. For my secondi, I did a full order of the fegato in padella, or calves liver seared with sage, spinach, braised artichokes, and proscuitto. When I ordered it, the waiter stopped for a second to make sure that I did indeed like liver. Once I confirmed, he beamed a smile and declared his love of the dish. The liver did not disappoint! It was minerally, with a great texture. So delicious. At this point, I was done. I couldn't eat another bite. That is, until the waiter surprised me with a slice of the chocolate walnut and amaretto cake. I wanted to hate him for bringing that out, but it was soooo good!

Once I got back to LA, I looked up the chef and came upon a video of her speaking in Brussels. She gave a brief history of the River Cafe and how it came to be. She was very captivating in explaining her mission and their processes, etc. But the one thing that really stood out to me was when she simply said, ""we want people feeling better then when they arrived."" That, in a nutshell, was my experience. I felt better (exponentially) then when I arrived."
River Café,1,5-Jul-22,5,"This legendary Italian on The River Thames in The Hammersmith area of London is a force of nature that came on the scene in 1987, and it feels a bit 87 in there, in the best way. The colors of the servers clothes, the aqua blue carpet, the mirrored bar and ceiling, the handwritten menu that changes daily gave me the feeling of the time I went to Maxwell's Plum with my dad when I was young. You feel the specialness of the room.

The food is delightful, the staff are a mix of young summer jobbers and old pros, all trained nicely. We booked a noon lunch and it was tremendous."
River Café,1,14-May-22,4,"We had a nice dinner here a few months back in March. It has a great vibe and definitely is a hot spot. If you can eat outside with the weather being nice, I think that would be a great experience. We were inside which was fine but its pretty crowded and noisy (even on a weekday) so if you want a quiet place for a meal, this probably isnt it.

The Jasmine cocktail was really nice and had good flavors to it. Our bottle of Amarone paired nicely with veal. We were a little disappointed not to get an explanation of the cheeses so would make sure you ask for that. The Recioto was a great dessert wine too.

Overall this is a really nice restaurant thats worth a visit but probably not in a regular rotation"
River Café,1,21-Jan-22,3,"I've been coming here irregularly over a few decades. It has to be said that it really isn't what it used to be in terms with f from is at least . The decor has changed also, and there are number of finishings in lurid bright colors, including the pink oven and the restrooms. The food was good, but really nothing special , with nothing memorable for the right reasons. A dish of langoustines with botlotti beans was a little bit lost for me, e
With the beans seemingly only there as a filler for the expensive leading cast. A red mullet dish with artichokes in the style of fritto misto was adequate, and again, nothing of note. Following this, a gnocchi dish with spinach and kale that looked beautiful with a very natural vibrant green. Unfortunately, the gnocchi, which should be ""soft pillows"" had quite a tough texture, that disappointed. Another dish of Rigatoni cattiatore, was mediocre at best.
OK, I suppose , but not worthy of awards or the £100 per person tag. There are better options in London. This restaurant has run its course, trading on yesteryears glories."
St. JOHN,1,7-Jul-24,5,"All around great food experience with high quality ingredients! Highly recommend the chicken liver toast to start! Dishes were full of so much flavor! I got the monkfish and my husband got the park beef, it was extremely tender. Menu does change daily though. Our server was helpful and walked us through the menu and his favorites. Reservations are a must! With seats still available guests walking in were turned away. I believe they run out of food and only have so much to serve each day. In other words, ingredients are fresh!! You won't be disappointed with any of the dishes you can't go wrong, it's truly an explosion of great flavors in your mouth with each bite!"
St. JOHN,1,3-Jun-24,5,"This restaurant has been on my list for years, and I finally got to it on a recent trip. Came with a large group and booked the private room, which was perfect for our needs. Service was excellent.

We ate:

+ Roast Bone marrow and parsley salad
+ Kohlrabi
+ Whole roast suckling pig
+ Potatoes and greens
+ Rhubarb pavlova
+ Ginger loaf and butterscotch sauce

The bone marrow was as perfect as everyone says - such a generous portion in each bone. Definitely the most amount of bone marrow I have ever seen in one place. It was the large format dining option, but still.

The whole roast suckling pig was just ridiculous. Really good. Also enjoyed the potatoes and greens because I am a huge cabbage fiend.

The desserts were tied with the bone marrow as my favorite dishes, though. I think I ate more of the dessert than anything else.

This location also has a mini bakery counter during the day, where they sell the bread and doughnuts. I grabbed a vanilla doughnut the next day and it was excellent.

Amazing all around!!!"
St. JOHN,1,29-May-24,2,The service was beyond slow as I thought maybe we did something wrong. It took 30 minutes it felt to get a second glass of wine. Food took forever and nothing really stood out. This was a restaurant recommended to me so I had high hopes. But nothing was memorable. Wouldn't recommend
St. JOHN,1,8-May-24,3,I was very excited to eat here. The menu changes daily and uses the animal head to tail. I fear my expectations weee too high for this place. The dishes were good but extremely simple. And that's their style. Simply dressed and seasoned. The very present Welsh rarebit and Madeline's were not to be missed. Reservations are must. Service was unexpectedly spotty but there may have been a shortage. Michelin rating very questionable in my opinion.
St. JOHN,1,9-Apr-24,5,"St. John is a must-stop on our visits to London. Since the menus change regularly, I was concerned on our scheduled date that some of the ""big hitters"" wouldn't be available. Well, we hit the menu jackpot! Deviled kidneys for a starter and goat faggots & mash for a main course. Seriously, it doesn't get any better for nose-to-tail enthusiasts! Mussels, Welsh Rarebit, green salad, and braised cabbage, hokey pokey ice cream and apple sorbet w/ vodka were some our other choices - all excellent.

Service was efficient and friendly. Atmosphere was energetic without being loud. SJ spaces out the dining room well so you never feel crowded. And finally, this has to be a ""best value"" Michelin star restaurant. We ate at Dishoom (love it!) the night before, and our tabs were pretty similar.

Cheers to the staff at St. John!"
St. JOHN,1,25-Jan-24,5,"It may sound like an oxymoron, but an unpretentious Michelin restaurant. I had a business lunch and it was great. The atmosphere is more like a bistro than a formal dining room, the service was efficient and formal rather than pretentious. I started with the brown crab, which was nice but the star was the saddleback, pork loin cooked a little pink. It was flavorful, tender, as good as can be. An enjoyable restaurant."
St. JOHN,1,20-Jan-24,3,"I was quite disappointed by this meal, from start to finish.

I'll start with the parts I enjoyed - the potatoes were great, dessert was great, and wine was great. The pigeon was prepared very well.

Unfortunately, I don't have many positive things to say beyond that.

We had to push through a crowd to enter the restaurant, and then we were seated in a dining room that felt like it belonged in an American bbq joint. The doors to the dining room were opened the whole time as servers were going in and out, which led to an unfortunate draft throughout the meal. This was probably a night-specific experience, but it set an unpleasant tone.

Service was slow and impersonal, although allergens/dietary restrictions were accommodated well.

The braised lamb was added onto the menu as a substitution for the game pie, and I truly could not eat more than a few bites of it. Flavors were unpleasant, and it was not prepared well.

Everything else was forgettable - the cabbage that came with the pigeon was ok, the beef and lentil broth was ok. Altogether it felt like a disjointed, careless meal.

I am disappointed because people talk about this place with such reverence, so I hoped my experience would be more pleasant. Not the place for me!"
St. JOHN,1,8-Dec-23,2,"We were super excited to dine at St John. Many food loving people recommend this place to us. I love whole animal butchery and simple honest cooking methods so why 2 stars?
 
Sad to say, we did not enjoy what we ate at St John Bar. Maybe it was an off night? Or I was expecting something more. I prepare similar but better food at home on a week night. For example, the bone marrows were just ordinary and needed more parsey. I prepare it the similar way but I cook local grass fed beef bone marrow over hard wood fire, sprinkle with flaky Læsø Salt & Tellicherry Peppercorns then dress it with fresh parsley from our garden and splash of white Balsamic vinegar.

Other dishes were ok as well but we felt they were overly rich and not balanced. Fish was fresh and fine but I do not understand their sauce pairing. Greens were overgrown, tough and too fibrous. People call me Bunny because I love raw greens more than anything but I could not eat it.

Kids enjoyed a mountain of the freshly baked Madeleines. They were 5 stars.
"
St. JOHN,1,29-Nov-23,1,"My wife and I dined at the Spitalfields location with clients some years ago and were told the raw pigeon was ""cooked perfectly,"" but not learning our lesson we returned to the Smithfield location recently. We both became ill hours later and remained unwell for several days. Again, the restaurant confirmed the meal was perfect and deflected blame. Could be coincidence. But we won't be returning."
St. JOHN,1,28-Sep-23,3,Discombobulated meal. Things came out without any explanation. We couldn't discern between a small side salad and a main course fish dish which tells you about portion size . It was underwhelming overall. Food was mediocre. Lights are super downstairs and there is zero ambiance. Wouldn't return.
St. JOHN,1,17-Sep-23,3,"The busser's uniform was torn at the shoulder. In a restaurant that exemplifies the beauty of simplicity, every small detail must be attended to. This tear was indicative of an overall sagging of attention. Our server brought our wine, opened-filled everyone's glass almost to the top and then presented the bottle for me to check the label. The wine, due to insane heat in London (33), was warm, and once 2/3 of the bottle was poured out, short of ice cubes in the glasses, not much could be done.
There was a lot of toast (lamb's brains, brown crab, girolles) and all of it was borderline burnt and too tough for even our steak knives. The salads were seriously over dressed, although the dressing was delicious, the overall effect was unpleasant. My grouse was excellent, a properly hung bird cooked to perfection.
I have been coming to St. John ever since it opened on each and every trip to London. My last trip was 5 years ago, and the difference between this trip and my last was remarkable and terribly disappointing. We were there on a Friday night and the dining room didn't fill up until 9pm. Like the wine, a victim of the heat I suppose. Have they over extended? The back of the menu is filled up with the other St. John operations. But I went ahead and kept my St John Marylebone reservation and was glad I did. More about that later."
St. JOHN,1,10-Sep-23,4,"First trip to London and had the most amazing meal. The Welsh Rarebit was the absolute best. I went local and had the turbot, leeks and lavabread, OUTSTANDING! The service was wonderful also."
St. JOHN,1,8-Sep-23,3,"I had dinner here, and I thought it was just alright. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I found the food to be just ok. The service was great, though! To start, we had the smoked cod roe on toast and the bone marrow and parsley salad. The smoked cod row basically just looked like smeared canned fish on toast, and that's how it tasted, too. The star of the whole meal was the bone marrow. That was amazing! For my main, I had the ox tongue with bacon and peas. It tasted like corned beef to me, but I'm not opposed to that. I really enjoy corned beef, but I wasn't expecting the tongue to taste like that. For dessert, I had the madeleines and Abbey's chocolate cake. The madeleines were warm, fluffy, and so light! I loved them! The chocolate cake was HUGE, and it was quite dense. I couldn't finish it.
"
St. JOHN,1,8-Jul-23,3,"This was hailed as the temple of modern British cooking, yet the food produced was mediocre. The bone marrow paired with crusty bread certainly delivered, yet that was the only one that was show-stopping. The pork cheek was just outright salty, to a point where the salt flavor takes away from the umami and meatiness of the pork. The sweetbreads, which I'm accustomed to eating, were decent. Just nothing out of the ordinary. The snails and trotters with barley had good flavor depth from the slow-cooked trotter, yet the other components didn't coalesce well together. I found the acid in the dish to be a touch too overpowering.

I'm not against eating ""adventurous"" proteins, they just have to be executed well. They weren't exactly at my visit."
St. JOHN,1,24-Jun-23,3,"Overall, ok place imo. The bread at St. John's is really good, along with the hot Madeline's that you can end your meal with. It's hard to get dinner reservations for St. John, which is testament to how good its perceived. Personally, not a fan, but did enjoy the bone marrow which is a most order along with the Madeline's. Our other main dish, was the special of the day, which was pig's head- a soupy type dish. Reserve a month in advance to get the date and time you want; lunch reservations are much easier to come by."
St. JOHN,1,20-Jun-23,4,"It's astounding how much service can affect one's experience of a meal. This was our last meal in London after two weeks in England, and while we had a memorable food experience, we also had a surly server that cast a shadow over the evening. What a shame.

We were meeting our friends here to celebrate one of their birthdays (a milestone birthday) and all of us were excited to be at the restaurant. The hostess was lovely and everything started well enough when we were told the specials, but then our waiter--an older gentleman who seemed like life dealt him a raw deal in a previous career--turned on us. One of us asked about a beer that seemed to be made in collaboration with the restaurant, and he was so offended by the question that he immediately became sarcastic and condescending. Maybe he thought we were idiotic Americans, but we didn't just fall off the turnip truck, the question was legitimate, and the guy was a total jerk for no reason. This same person also (foolishly) put in our dinner order, and he immediately balked saying that that was only enough food for two people--(!!!!!!!????!?!?)--so we tacked on a couple more dishes to appease him. The amount of food probably would have been fine, and maybe we could have used one or two more dishes, but his approach was so passive-aggressive that we were completely bewildered.

Anyway, enough about that miserable wretch. Let's move on to the food, which was an edible celebration. We started with the bone marrow, natch, and it was so decadently juicy, paired with toast and parsley salad to offset the richness. Just: yes. The cured sea trout was par for the course, but we all loved the special beef salad which came out with a phenomenal dressing that made the whole plate sing.

For our mains, the ox cheeks was practically melting it was so tender. There was a bit more fat than we would have preferred, but no matter. The side of greens was cabbage that was buttered beyond belief, so of course it tasted great. The whole mackerel special was a masterpiece: our kid practically ate half of the whole fish it was so pleasantly flaky and juicy. We don't love having to pick bones out since we're not tableside-cutting experts, but that ended up being half of the fun. The side salad had a hint of horseradish that complemented everything else on the table. We found the fennel gratin a bit too rich, but it was such unique take that we didn't mind.

We went baller for dessert. We admit that our waiter-demon did have the foresight/slice of kindness in his heart to bring out a birthday candle for our friends, so that was an appreciated surprise. The ice cream was good, as was the mousse, but the blackberry trifle stole our hearts--there was a surprise on the spoon every time that you dug into the bowl. We also ordered a half dozen madeleines, which came out warm and fluffy with just the tiniest hint of crisp. Proust would have been happy.

Bottom line is that we had a delicious and memorable meal here and an overall jolly good time with our friends celebrating a big birthday. While the server unequivocally spoiled certain aspects of the evening, we didn't let him rain on our parade and we'll remember St. JOHN fondly with the hope of going again should we find ourselves back in this wonderful city and country. It was the sumptuous final meal of our trip, so four happy stars wishing that we could have brought it to five."
St. JOHN,1,28-Apr-23,5,"I had the pleasure of eating at a collaborative dinner between Fergus Henderson and David Chang at Ssam Bar back in 2009 and was blown away with the amazing tastes that Henderson could coax out of the nastiest bits of meat -- made a promise to myself I would try to make it to St John one day.

Fast forward almost 14 years and my wife and I were in London and at St John. Despite going there the day we arrived thus running on little to no sleep, St John was still the best meal we had in the 10 days we were there.

The ambiance is literally non existent, with white walls, no noise and no decor except for lots of coat hooks (which came in handy considering it was January). Service was perfunctory but polite.

As to the food:

1. Bone marrow salad -- as much as it is a definite must order it was my least favorite of all the dishes;

2. Crispy pork with chicory -- fantastic, shatteringly crisp pork in a mustard dressing with assorted lettuces;

3. Welsh rarebit -- the best cheese toast I've ever had;

4. Mallard with beetroot -- the duck was a tad chewy but the tastes were fantastic;

5. Braised halibut with Swede -- assertively fishy but wonderful with the turnips alongside it (a combo I never would have thought of)

And

6. Madelines -- not too sweet and perfectly baked, great way to end the meal.

The Ninth,1,10-May-24,5,"Wonderful restaurant in the heart of Londons restaurant district. A beautiful visual combination of rustic meets industrial as soon as you enter. Bistro style seating immediately creates a more relaxed Michelin atmosphere while keeping the same service and culinary excellence as the stuffiest French restaurant. The food was a lovely combination of fusion of Italian meets Asian. My favorite dish of the night was yellowtail perfectly sliced topped with thin slices of Meyer lemon, and pickled white asparagus that was shaved post pickle. The contrast between tart and sweet was perfectly balanced finished with a broken vinaigrette sat in a brodo like mixture.

We also really enjoyed the Imberico pork with a variations of ramps, garlic, in an absolutely stunning pork jus. We chose to include the wine pairing which was substantial and uniquely laid out with grapes from a variety of regions throughout the globe perfectly described by our friendly Sommelier. When in London The ninth is a must for those looking for great food, welcoming staff, and beautifully curated libations"
The Ninth,1,1-Nov-23,1,"We had a HORRIBLE experience at The Ninth - unapologetic server and management after a mistake was made. In fact they rolled their eyes and laughed when they made mistake. Didn't apologize once, we waited at the table to see if the manager came over...nothing. My husband approached him. Still nothing - he laughed and rolled his eyes again.

SHOCKED this place has a Michelin star. Does not deserve it in our opinion.

The server did not speak much to us, no ""are you done?"", ""how is it?"", NOTHING! She would just grab the dishes and walk away. Never came back to table to check-in.

Pros: food was good, ambience was approachable, crispy potatoes and pain Perdue were outstanding

Cons: unapologetic server and management after a mistake was made; truly unacceptable at a Michelin star restaurant, lukewarm entrees

Would never go back or recommend to anyone. Horrible service."
The Ninth,1,13-Jul-23,5,"This little gem provides the perfect dinner experience in London. The plates are meant to be shared but you'll wish you didn't have to share. We tried a wide variety of items and each was beautifully prepared and delicious--with unique combos of flavor. Try the Coccoli--they are amazing, as is the Rabbit Agnolotti. Leave room for dessert--you'll thank me later. Note: they have indoor and outdoor seating, but make reservations. This restaurant has received a Michelin star. Our service was also fantastic even though they were packed"
The Ninth,1,19-Jun-23,4,"Affordable one Michelin star experience.
The signature pain perdu was delicious, with an extremely soft and milky inside with a well caramelized sugar coating. The vanilla ice cream with crumbles was nothing special, good to pair with the hot toast though.
The lamb chop was well charred and super juicy & tender. However, the sweet mint & anchovy dressing on the lamb chop was not a very good pairing with the lamb, amplifying the smell, would suggest pairing it with the broccolinis.
Environment was okay with mostly open air but not air conditioning. They took quite a while to cook the lamb so I finished the dessert first."
The Ninth,1,31-May-23,5,"Went to dinner to celebrate some recent work milestones. The service was excellent and the wait staff was very helpful with selecting the right wine for our meal. The food was amazing and the small plates made for a perfect date night. To top it all off, the pain perdu was one of the best desserts I've ever had. My wife and I will certainly be coming back the next time we're in London."
The Ninth,1,20-Mar-23,5,French cuisine with a Mediterranean twist that earned a Michelin star. They were closed for almost a year due to a fire but reopened earlier this month. Everything was incredible. The salted beef cheek & tongue and pain perdu (dessert) were the highlight. The spaghetti was also amazing as well. Also don't sleep on the cocktails.
The Ninth,1,3-Apr-22,5,"A relatively new (5 years) restaurant in Fitzrovia that seems to be doing very well, post-Covid. A bit small, with only two dozen seats and maybe another half-dozen at the tiny bar, but this allows the competent staff easy control of the simply decorated room.

I decided on a seafood meal, selecting smoked eel and panisse (chickpea cake), flamed mackerel with kohlrabi and lemon, roast cod with artichoke and more parnisse in a ""fish-and-chips"" display, and finishing with cheesecake with poached rhubarb. I only think that the sommelier could had been a bit more helpful with my wine selection, instead of allowing me to select just a single bottle.

I really enjoy the open kitchen concept, but the building's footprint here is far too small, all the food appears via dumbwaiter behind the bar.

The enthusiastic servers, the flavors of each dish, the simple, effective plating means I'll have to return. And soon.

2022 04 01. M1."
The Ninth,1,31-Jan-22,5,"I can't stop recommending this place. We had such an awesome time and the food was so amazing.
The service was on point, they made you feel as the only one on the restaurant and everyone had a smile all the time.
The combination of flavours and the attention to detail on the dishes was from another planet.
They 100% deserve their Michelin star.
Don't miss it!"
Trinity,1,4-Oct-23,5,"Incredible service, unique presentation and delicious flavors. My boyfriend took me here for my belated birthday lunch, and the experience was top-notch. I wouldn't expect any less from a Michelin-starred restaurant.

I opted for the 4-course and he opted for the 3-course package.

MUST ORDER: Clapham honey soufflé - divine intervention! I keep thinking about this dessert.

Service and presentation was impeccable. Great for a celebratory occasion or a fancy meal out."
Trishna,1,20-Jul-24,4,"Really great experience dining solo here. The service was impeccable.

The papads were crispy and chutneys were flavorful- I wanted to eat the whole box but had to stop myself or I wouldn't be able to eat the rest of the meal. 5/5

Squid & shrimps 5/5: crispy but not oily, tender and not tough

Duck chutney seekh 3/5: not super impressive or memorable, it was fine

Gongura Lamb 5/5: loved the deep flavor that had been developed. Hard to find this in the US. Really enjoyed the potatoes that came with it as well. The naan was overly salty though.

Mango & pistachio kheer 4/5: enjoyable if you like rice pudding

Trishna,1,18-Jul-24,5,"We had an all-around excellent dinner at Trishna. Back in London, where I first had high-quality authentic Indian cuisine long before it was ever available in the U.S.A., Trishna delivered on all counts: nice ambience in posh Marylebone area, excellent service and awesome, tasty cuisine. In particular, the Tandoori lamb chops were outstanding. Highly recommend."
Trishna,1,22-Jun-24,5,"Very refined Indian food served by friendly people in a comfortable setting. I was surprised by the variety of pappadum offered with three tasty chutneys. We ordered coconut curry leaf scallops, guinea fowl pepper fry, tandoori venison (Hiram ki boti), and gongura lamb. The venison was very tender and delicious. I don't always like lamb (it can be too strong for me), but here it was mild and very tasty. The guinea fowl was my surprise favorite and also the spiciest of the four. Also enjoyed my cocktail, a Kulukki Fizz (Ketel One vodka infused with Indian green chili)."
Trishna,1,14-May-24,4,"We went to Trishna while visiting London. I was able to get an early dinner reservation last minute so when we arrived we were one of the first ones. Service was amazing! Everyone was friendly and knowledgeable. The inside of the restaurant was cozy and inviting. I liked the artwork they had throughout.

We tried the Chemmeen Manga Curry [Vannamei prawn, coconut, green mango, Malabar tamarind] & Cashew & Pepper Chicken Curry [roasted coconut & cashew nut, telicherry peppercorn]. We also added a bowl of rice and the naan to split since everything is a la carte. Overall, the curries were amazing and full of flavor. The naan was fresh and delicious too.

I do think it is very over-priced though. We left feeling not satisfied with what we paid. The allure of a ""Michelin star"" is what drew us in but I would have been just as happy food-wise at any other local Indian restaurant (and for less money). If you do go, I would recommend trying one of the tasting menus instead of the a la carte menu. It looked like a better deal with a variety of different plates to try."
Trishna,1,13-May-24,5,Had the 5 course tasting meal. It was fabulous. Great choices for each course. Service and pacing were right on. Price was very fair. Vibe was casual but cool. Highly recommend Trishna.
Trishna,1,27-Apr-24,3,"Came here for a job celebration! Service was really nice, the waiters were cordial and polite. However they didn't bring water often enough..which was bothersome at times as the food was super spicy!!

My friend and I got the tasting menu which had a variety of food and also sizeable portions which was good. However the taste of the food was generally not my personal style - for instance, at the beginning they brought out a variety of papads and chutneys. This was quite nice of them but tasted really strange to me.

The tasting menu included an appetizer of Aloo Chaat (ratte potatoes, masala chickpea, tamarind, sweet yoghurt) which was maybe my favorite dish of the evening. It was really good! Then I tried the Duck Chutney Seekh (tomato tokku, Kashmiri chilli, shallot, pineapple chutney), which was also pretty good.

For the main course I had Cashew & Pepper Chicken (roasted coconut & cashew nut, telicherry peppercorns) which again was really spicy but tasted not bad. It came with rice and naan. And the dessert Custard Apple Kulfi (falooda, basil seeds, gulab jamun, patissa crumble) had a variety of flavors and looked really cool and interesting, but wasn't my style taste-wise.

In terms of ambience it was quite a few business people, some couples, relatively dim warm lighting, and generally a pleasant place :)"
Trishna,1,26-Apr-24,1,"So disappointed with this restaurant. Got the prix fixe menu. The good was genuinely horrible and I have no idea how it got a Michelin star. The service was great but the cocktails were poorly made, weak, and a weird lukewarm temperature. The food was either overly salty, too vinegary, or completely bland with no other redeeming flavors to make the food complex. Even the dessert tasted stale and cheap like it had been sitting out on a bakery shelf for days. Save for your money and go elsewhere. Poor food for such a high price."
Trishna,1,5-Apr-24,5,"Having lunch at Trishna was a wonderful experience! The food is the best Indian food I have ever had, and you can't beat the value for dining at a Michelin restaurant! Great staff who really want you to have a wonderful experience!
"
Trishna,1,10-Mar-24,5,"Both the food and service at Trishna are truly exceptional. Both our waitress and the sommelier were friendly and eager to please.

Although they are known as one of the most price conscious Michelin stars in London, their food is amazing and you should absolutely splurge on the tasting menu and wine pairings, £180 combined.

We loved the bread service with chutneys, the guinea fowl, and the lamb. I also really liked that they served gin from India.

Perhaps what was most impressive was how well they paired wine with the bold flavors of their food. Every pairing was a wonderful match elevating the already excellent food.

The space is intimate, but sleek. And we perfect seat in the front window. Overall we loved our dinner at Trishna."
Trishna,1,8-Mar-24,5,"I've been trying to find the words to describe my experience at Trishna, and to be honest, I'm not positive I'll ever truly find the words to do it justice. We were not entirely sure what to expect from our visit here, but it's safe to say that it surpassed anything we could've even imagined.

My partner and I both chose to do the tasting menu, largely choosing different plates so we could try a number of different dishes. Gotta say, I highly recommend this as the way to go. I could rave for hours about how incredible each individual dish was, but I will simply list a few standouts:
- Nandu Varuval
- Coconut and Curry Leaf Scallop
- Tandoori Lamb Chop
- Gongura Lamb
There was not a single dish out of the dozen or so we tried that I wouldn't order again, but these four in particular were mindblowing. It's been a few months since our visit, and I still dream about the Gongura Lamb. All of the flavors we had were exceptional, and the service was incredible to boot.

Trishna was not only our favorite meal in London, but one of our favorite meals overall to date. Michelin like I've never previously experienced. I cannot recommend enough making a reservation and swinging by for a meal that will change your life."
Trishna,1,7-Mar-24,4,"OMG so much food!! Felt bad I couldn't finish it all! Everything was good to great. The service was super friendly, just top notch. Gave it four instead of five stars mostly because I thought the final plate just didn't live up to the rest of the tasting menu. But all in all a great meal!"
Trishna,1,22-Feb-24,5,amazing experience. tasting menu and wine pairings were spectacular. service was excellent all around. intimate setting in a lovely area of london.
Trishna,1,3-Feb-24,5,"This is easily my fav place to eat in London. The staff is EXCEPTIONAL. the food is outrageous delicious. My
Top 3 Indian restaurants i have ever been to."
Trishna,1,12-Jan-24,5,The best Indian food I ever tasted in my life. No wonder it's a Michelin resto! Wow. By far my favorite spot in London.
Trishna,1,2-Dec-23,5,"Wow this was perhaps the best Indian food I've ever had. I suggest you opt for the Tasting Menu which offers both a vegetarian and meat/poultry based. I went with the vegetarian menu and thoroughly enjoyed every dish presented. I paired my selection with a nice carafe of Riesling which really brought out the flavors even more. Staff are friendly, helpful and informed. Can't recommend enough."
Trishna,1,28-Nov-23,5,"Excellent food, cocktail and service. I would expect when wine is poured to have customer taste it before a full glass is poured. That's just customary in any restaurant that serves wine. Unfortunately not followed and wine that was poured was oxidized and lacked taste. As everything else was exceptional I just didn't send the wine back."
Trishna,1,9-Oct-23,5,"Straight up amazing. I make it a tradition to go to one upscale meal on vacation, and Trishna was a great choice.

Having a Michelin star, my expectations were very high and they were definitely met.

We first started with the drinks which were amazing; we then proceeded to order the short rib, scallops, paneer, and samoas. Think traditional Indian food with a slight experimental touch. Please note that the servings are very generous. Two entries and an appetizer should be enough for two people.

In terms of the customer service, all the staff is very helpful and cordial. And they are happy to explain the menu. As for the environment, it is a perfect place for a nice get-together or a date.

Quick tips, you will need a reservation if you arrive later at night. However, if you get there at the opening, you might be able to get a walk-in appointment. Thank you, Trishna for a wonderful night in London!"
Trishna,1,2-Oct-23,5,"Cozy restaurant with the best Indian food I've ever had. The service, like the food: impecable. Great wine list. Need to book in advance."
Trishna,1,17-Sep-23,5,"Dinner here was the highlight of our London trip! We both got the tasting menu and each course was flavorful and generous. Highlights are the scallops, lamb, and shrimp dishes."
Trishna,1,22-Aug-23,5,"Everyone MUST come here. Truly every single thing I put in my mouth blew my mind. As an Indian and a vegetarian, I have had my fair share of amazing Indian cuisine. However the freshness and balance of flavors in these dishes simply could not compare. I'm not usually one to go for paneer, but wow do I dream about the paneer tikka here. The badami broccoli was similarly fantastic. Everything was inventive and delicious! And the service was spectacular!"
Trishna,1,21-Aug-23,5,"Food 10/10
The perfect amount of spice for someone with an okay spice tolerance. Super flavorful dishes, and I didn't feel like the heat was overpowering or taking away from the flavors. We ordered the chutney to start, and I loved the lightness of the rice crisps, while the mango chutney was outstanding. For appetizers, we got the soft shell crab, fried squid and shrimp, and scallops. You can't go wrong with any of those dishes, but my favorite was the soft shell crab, as it came with a beautiful sauce. A lot of frying though, so I was already feeling the meal when the mains came. The cashew chicken can be skipped, but the lamb leg I highly recommend-a bit of smoke and a lot tender. Next time, would skip on the naan just due to the sheer amount of food they serve.

Atmosphere 9/10
Super cool vintage/rustic industrial vibes, with some mirrored panel walls and a beautiful selection of lighting. Comfortable seats and quite intimidate yet modern feel.

Service 10/10
Very friendly service, accommodating and made sure that we were happy with what we ordered and the pace of the meal."
Trishna,1,13-Aug-23,5,"We arrived for dinner earlier than our reservation but were accommodated immediately with a table. Everything was a delight, from the dining area to the service and, of course, the food and drink. My adult son opted for an iced tea that he said balanced fruit with the tea and was not overly sweet. I had a gin and tonic with a recommendation by one of our servers of the best gin. Was a wonderful drink. For dinner, we ordered off the a la carte menu. We got the tandoor lamb chops (our favorite), the short rib (succulent), the chicken biryani, and the coconut cashew chicken, along with two types of naan and extra raita. We shared all of it amongst the four of us and we enjoyed every bite. For dessert we opted for the sorbet trio, a delight. Lastly, we were presented with truffles along with I believe were date squares, a perfect end to a perfect meal. Thank you for being the culinary highlight of our trip to London!"
Trishna,1,11-Aug-23,5,Very deserving of one Michelin star. Trishna is in a cute and quiet (safe-appearing) neighborhood a few blocks from the Baker Street station. I was too full for one of the set menus so I ordered a La carte items. Got the beet salad (I think it was called the Tawa salad) and I really really loved it--I would highly recommend especially if you like unique/exotic flavors in salads. Also had one of the paneers and it was fantastic as well. For dessert I had the rose-lychee kulfi with excellent flavors although it was slightly over frozen when served. Service was excellent! It was also very easy to book online--I booked 1-2 days in advance and was able to get a late evening dinner spot.
Trishna,1,10-Jul-23,5,"If you only have time for one meal in London, have it at Trishna. We were visiting London for less than one day so I could see family. It was a whirlwind of a trip that got us into London around 12pm and out again by 10pm.

Trishna had been on my to-eat list for awhile, and I was determined to make it happen this trip for our anniversary. We got there early before our reservations and were able to snag a table al fresco on a beautiful British summer evening.

The attention to detail is incredible at this restaurant. We had someone that explained the menu, another person for cocktails, another for something else. The parade of people taking care of us never seemed to end, and the execution of the meal was perfection to the last bite.

We decided to start with the coconut and curried leaf scallops. Each bite melted on the tongue with a symphony of flavors and textures. For our main course we shared the Dorset brown crab which was nothing like I expected and absolutely scrumptious. The Mango Shrimp Curry was a revelation on the tongue. The breads and rice made for the ideal accompaniment for these dishes. I'm so used to asking for chutneys and raita with my Indian food that we defaulted to doing so here, but it was one hundred percent unnecessary. Everything was so expertly balanced that the chutneys were superfluous although the raita offered some cool down from the heat.

The place also has a spectacular gin menu which tickled my fancy. The server recommended one he mentioned hailed from his home town in India. How could I say no to that?

Our meal finished off with a delightful slice of chocolate cake and decadent spiced truffles and rose sweets. Such a perfect ending to a delicious meal before we made the trek back to Heathrow."
Trishna,1,2-Jun-23,5,A must try if you're in London - more specifically the Marlyebone area! We stopped here late one evening and it did not disappoint. The food was absolutely delicious and the servers are very attentive! Highly recommend.
Trishna,1,1-Jun-23,5,"Of the several Indian fine dining restaurants I've been to, Trishna has been my favourite.

The service is impeccable and personalized. I was presented with a dairy free menu when I told them about my dietary preferences, and I loved that I had many options for each course (the two starters, main course, and dessert).

The lunch set menu comes with a beyond generous tasting of different dishes; the papads and chutneys were already quite tasty. The soft shell crab (with the crab paste) was a true delight, as was the broccoli second starter (perhaps my favourite broccoli dish of all time!)

The main course was tasty albeit less ""creative"" - a curried chicken with naan, potatoes, and rice. I was so full I had to ask for leftovers.

The tandoori pineapple to end the meal was a nice touch. Not too sweet, but also intriguing enough with a smoky flavor."
Trishna,1,23-May-23,5,"Excellent food. Great service and tremendous ambiance.

Very South Indian food with coconut milk and South Indian spices."
Trishna,1,30-Apr-23,3,"If Trishna was not a Michelin star restaurant, I would probably give it 4 stars at the minimum. However, I have to hold it to a high standard since it is a Michelin star restaurant. I had the tasting menu along with the wine tasting.

Appetizer - 5 stars
Mango chutney is amazing. Interesting choice of papadum but it felt some of this was more for shock value instead if enhancing the flavor. Others were good as well but it did not suit my flavor palette. I recommend trying each one to find which suits you.
Wine Pairing- It was a champagne that complemented the starter and appetizer perfectly.

Scallops - 2 stars
Underwhelming. I didn't take many notes on this but I can't even remember the dish.

Guinea Fowl - 5 stars
An absolutely amazing dish. I am a fan of spicy food but this wasn't spicy. Instead, it was packed with flavor. Highly recommended
Wine Pairing. Somewhat underwhelming. It should have been bolder since the fowl was so flavorful.

Lambchop with radish salad - 3 stars
Lambchop tasted amazing. One of the best I have had.
The salad pair well with the lamb but it left much to be desired. To get the full effect, you needed to eat it almost immediately afterwards. It provides a very refreshing taste with slight kick from the horse radish. I felt the salad was very mediocre on it's owns.
Wine pairing- best so far. It complemented the lambchop and salad perfectly.

Lambchop curry - 3 stars
Curry was ok. It was complemented the lentils very well. The produced effect was a good result. The issue is that neither of these dishes were great as a standalone. I also expected a complement to be better than a good result.
The highlight was definitely the spinach side dish which tasted amazing. Probably one of the best vegetable dishes I have had. Oh, I hate spinach btw.

Torte - 3 stars
chocolate
Torte with a chiki bottom.
Most disappointing dessert.
This is prob on of the best chocolate dessert I have had in my life.
Why is it disappoint? The flavor of the chocolate torte was rich that complemented the Chika crust. The issue was that this crust made up 1/3 of the bottom of the torte. I am not sure why it didn't make up the entire bottom. The ice cream that complemented it was mild in flavor. There were hints of cardamom when it was ate by itself but the flavor was overpowered when combined with the torte.
Wine Pairing - It was well paired. The wine was sweeter which complemented the dessert well.

I was pretty disappointed overall. I traveled to Europe on a solo trip and I had one of the best culinary experiences of my life in Portugal. I looked up this restaurant because I heard it was on par with Gymkhana and there no reservations available during my trip. Trishna does offer one of two choices for each entre. It could be the other choice tasted better but I expected more from a restaurant that has a Michelin star.
"
Trishna,1,5-Feb-23,5,"I was lucky to find availability for a late weekend lunch as I found it to be a popular place. To start off with, the restaurant itself has such lovely character, with various rooms, steps leading down to the WC, etc. Every course I had on the tasting menu was divine and the service was top notch! I was very pleased with the advice given on which courses to try as I debated between a few. I'll definitely recommend Trishna to family and friends visiting London!"
Trishna,1,7-Jan-23,5,"This place was amazing - great customer service and the food was delicious!

Some on the spicier dishes with some heat but really bold flavors. Pricier for indian food but worth it as it's michelin rated. I really enjoyed the indian inspirated cocktails as well. This was definitely a favorite restaurant while visiting London. Would go back for sure!"
Umu,1,6-Oct-23,5,"Everything about this place is remarkable. The service was impeccable, the ambiance trendy yet comfortable and the food was outstanding. My only complaint is that you can't have the £250 tasting menu unless everybody else in the table gets it and the menu is not fit for everybody."
Veeraswamy,1,5-Jun-24,4,"This is the oldest Indian restaurant in the
City I see why its very good but it's a la
Too boujee for my tastes"
Veeraswamy,1,1-Jun-24,5,"There was really nothing missing from this Michelin-star historic London restaurant. The atmosphere was inviting without being a pedantic homage to India as is common in Indian restaurants. The food was excellent. We had the muligatawny (awesome) chicken masala, the mixed bread basket (which was way too much for a party of two - one selection would have been a better choice), the samosas and a lamb shank breaded, fried and with a delicious, savory sauce. The chicken and lamb were tender and delicious. The fresh, aromatic spices popped with every bite. The service was professional and friendly from the door to the good-bye. Do not expect American top-shelf obeisance. This is more of a casual feel but with an upscale crowd and excellent presentation of dishes. We appreciated the artistry."
Veeraswamy,1,8-May-24,5,"Almost a 100 years old! Granted I'm from Miami, an Indian food desert. Previous best Indian was in Singapore, but veeraswamy was the best Indian experience I've had so far. The first dish we had was scallops, good but the weakest dish we would have here. The crab briyani and the lamb shank in pastry were phenomenal. Service was adequate without being overbearing. The restaurant is gorgeous and fun to get into entering through and elevator that takes you to the top floor."
Veeraswamy,1,11-Apr-24,5,Best food we had while in London and probably the best Indian food we've ever had. Service was great and the atmosphere was nice as well.
Veeraswamy,1,28-Jan-24,5,"One of our goals on our trip to London this month was to find the best Indian food. This was it! Comfortable ambiance. Great hospitality. But most importantly, excellent cuisine. Some others are more highly touted with more extravagant build-outs, but none were comparable in terms of what pleases the palate."
Veeraswamy,1,14-Jan-24,5,"Stumbled upon this restaurant yesterday and search of Indian food. As Destiny would have it, Veeraswy is the oldest Indian restaurant in London and has a rich history. There is a sense of classiness, and all the staff, including general managers are extremely professional and attentive.

The food was delicious, but expect to pay accordingly, as there was a minimum of £55 per head although we probably spent over 300 pounds, including the drinks with the party of three.

I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for authentic Indian food with great service and ambience"
Veeraswamy,1,6-Jan-24,5,Service and food top notch. Exciting setting. Great location. A little pricey. My go to whenever in London
Veeraswamy,1,27-Dec-23,5,"just a wonderful restaurant. The food is delicious, succulent traditional, and yet inventive. Enjoyed every bite and it was worth every scent. I was at this restaurant 50 years ago and remembered it. It has changed, I think it's gotten better, more refined, and a bit less spicy! I highly recommend it for a special occasion"
Veeraswamy,1,6-Nov-23,5,This restaurant is truly exceptional. I have been visiting veeraswamy every time I'm in London for over 25 years. This visit was my best yet. Try the tasting menu and you'll never be disappointed.
Veeraswamy,1,4-Nov-23,5,Food and cocktails were amazing. Service was really top notch... specially David! we loved the whole experience of dining in one of the best restaurants in London
Veeraswamy,1,9-Oct-23,5,"Best Indian food I've ever had in the best setting. I went for dinner 8 years ago for work, and back again a couple of weeks ago with my husband and he was so impressed. We had a great dinner, one of the best we had on our whole 2 week trip to Paris, Amsterdam, and London. 5 stars, worth taking a date or group for a special occasion or just when you want incredible food. No complaints. I also messed up the time of our reservation (booked 10p but meant to book 8p) and they were able to accommodate us at the time we showed up. Really appreciated that since we had plans for the other evenings we were in London and wouldn't have been able to eat here this trip if they wouldn't have been able to fit us in."
Veeraswamy,1,4-Sep-23,5,"Having just landed from a red-eye flight from San Francisco, the first thing I needed to do is to find a great place for dinner. All of my friends told me that London has the best Indian food and one of my colleagues recommended Veeraswamy. I didn't have reservations but they were able to take me at 5:30 pm. The signage is a little inconspicuous and I almost missed it.

The host welcomed me by saying ""This is the best Indian restaurant in the world. We are not going to disappoint."" They quickly sat me down and handed me the food and drinks menus. I saw that they had a four course tasting menu and that's almost an automatic thing for me to order. For my non-alcoholic drink, I chose the classic mango lassi.

The tasting menu started with an amuse - a really small cup of fragrant Mulligatawny soup. That was just amazing and I knew that this was a great choice for my first dinner in London. The appetizers included a Tiger Prawn and Chicken Tikka Masala - both were just excellent and full of different flavors. The main course was four different curries (lobster, chicken, lamb and pineapple) with some naan and their tomato rice. I was just blown away by the different curries. My favorite was the lobster curry and I couldn't stop dipping my naan in it. I am just stunned by all the flavors from the various curries and the balance accomplished in each dish. Indian food in the US doesn't come close. Dessert was chocolate ganache - not particularly Indian but it was definitely a Michelin-level dish. The mango lassi was very tasty as well.

Service was just excellent and the meal cost me about 95 pounds. The best part is that I didn't have to pay all sorts of fees and gratuity like in SF. The dining room was elegant and it's the type of anachronistic ambiance that I really enjoy. This was definitely a Michelin star dining experience. Highly, highly recommended.

"
Veeraswamy,1,8-Aug-23,5,"Absolutely fantastic. Tucked away and hidden upstairs, it feels like a little secret when the elevator opens to the gorgeous dining area. Everything was beautiful, the service was impeccable, and the food was second to none. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings and it was a great experience. They paced the meal well and everything was delicious. We dressed up for a date, but several people were casual in jeans. We were just visiting the area, but I can see this being a place we hit every time we are in London!"
Veeraswamy,1,11-Jul-23,5,5 stars are not enough for this gem! Worth every pound! I recommend the tasting menu and if you're a wine drinker going with the wine pairing. Their food and wine portions are generous and delicious. Make a reservation.
Veeraswamy,1,28-Jun-23,4,"Good food and wonderful ambiance! Just be the prepared for a $$$$ meal ( 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, 1 inexpensive bottle of wine and 3 cocktails $467USD). Great for a special occasion. We went before seeing Phantom at His Majesty's Theater."
Veeraswamy,1,23-Jun-23,5,"This is place is a must if you are visiting London and love Indian food. Amazing and friendly service, delicious food and beautiful decoration. Thank you Veeraswamy! You never disappoint :)"
Veeraswamy,1,12-Jun-23,5,"My first dinner here was twenty years ago, and I was so happy to return again for dinner last evening. It was exactly as wonderful as I remembered. Food was delicious, service perfect, and the atmosphere lively and elegant. The charming doorman sets a lovely tone both before and after dinner!"
Veeraswamy,1,2-Jun-23,5,"Great food, service, and ambiance. The crab cake and lentil soup are fantastic appetizers. Highly recommend."
Veeraswamy,1,1-Jun-23,5,First time in London and this was the one restaurant recommended to dine at. It isn't super cheap but worth every penny. Best Indian food I've ever had and beautiful interior in the heart of London.
Veeraswamy,1,31-May-23,5,Apps and cocktails were great! The lamb dishes were my favorite as well as the butter chicken. Pretty spicy dishes so get plenty of water! Amazing restaurant with great vibe.
Veeraswamy,1,8-May-23,5,I loved the tasting menu and thank the chef for allowing me to order that for my birthday dinner!All of my friends who came with me last night spoke very highly of the food and restaurant both! It was a lovely time! They thought the whole restaurant was beautiful.
Veeraswamy,1,29-Apr-23,5,"The food is delicious and there is a varied menu, especially for vegetarians. More than that, the people here are more than friendly and gracious. I was with a party of 8--half of us were locals. We were served efficiently and it seemed that the people there actually loved their jobs, showing off their food, and welcoming guests."
Veeraswamy,1,26-Apr-23,5,Absolutely the best Indian cuisine we have ever had and amazing service. We will definitely be back on our next trip to London!
Veeraswamy,1,26-Apr-23,5,"The food service and ambiance were amazing. Really enjoyed our visit. Such a great way to visit with good friends over an amazing meal. We did the tasting menu. If you are with others, suggest one of you get the vegetarian and another the meat samplers and share."
Veeraswamy,1,24-Apr-23,5,A must go if you are in London! unique dishes but also classics for the less adventurous. we will definitely be back. drinks are amazing.
Wild Honey St James,1,26-Jun-24,5,"This was my first Michelin-star experience, and it was incredible. The modern, sleek interior felt upscale and cozy. Service was attentive and genuine.

We started off with some delicious sourdough bread, a pea tart, and puff pastry filled with chicken pate. I have never had pate, and wow was it good. Salty and tasty - both my wife and I made audible ""yums"" as we ate.

My next course was agnolotti with ricotta. It was divine. Truly one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. The pasta was homemade and the perfect al dente. There were so many textures in the dish. I cleared my place. My wife had the crisp Sutton hoo chicken, and she raved about it.

My entree was the Cornish monkfish. Another first for me, and the seasoning was perfect. There were so many layers of flavor, and the fish had a meaty texture, making it equally satiating as delicious.

For dessert, the Madeleines were an experience. Warm, freshly baked, incredible texture, and accompanied by vanilla ice cream with the titular wild honey! Just pure yum!

This was a delectable dining experience!!
"
Wild Honey St James,1,17-Jun-24,5,"One of the most wonderful experience we've had! We came to London for our anniversary trip and I wanted to dine at a Michelin establishment. From the service to the food, everything was perfect and amazing. The staff was so welcoming and the presentation of dishes were magnificent."
Wild Honey St James,1,14-Jan-24,5,"We had a great dinner here back in November. The service was excellent, the drinks (negroni and salvia) tasty and the food outstanding. I wish I could remember the dishes we had specifically but we will definitely come back!"
Wild Honey St James,1,29-Sep-23,5,"Their pre theatre dining is a fantastic deal.

I was a little nervous that for 40 pounds I'd leave hungry, but I left full and satisfied. We started with an a la carte snack of whipped cod's roe, fig oil, nasturtium. I'm glad they bring bread, because it went really well it with. Their bread is actually a huge highlight of the meal, it is delicious.

I started with a kind of chicken pate looking thing that was absolutely delicious. For the main I got cornish cod, which was also very well done, it could be cut with a fork. The only thing I was meh on was the dessert, the rice pudding. I found it just ok, but I wish they had a cheese plate option for the desert, I'm not really into sweets. On their sample menu there is a cheese option so it may be worth asking.

There isn't a bathroom close by, you have to walk through the hotel, which I find a little odd. Otherwise the ambiance is beautiful and the staff was very attentive.

I would be happy to come back here and would recommend it if you are looking for a pre theatre place to eat."
Wild Honey St James,1,17-Aug-23,5,"Eating here was one of the highlights of our short London visit. The service, food, and ambiance did not disappoint. We had our one year old in tow, and our server doted on him as a nice bonus. 100% recommend"
Wild Honey St James,1,3-Aug-23,5,"Amazing food, amazing service and a great ambiance. Will be coming back next time I am in London."
Wild Honey St James,1,4-Jun-23,5,Absolutely a five star experience. We celebrated our 20 year anniversary here yesterday. Reserved a table at 5:30 ahead of a show. The staff was amazing and very friendly. The barman makes a superb old fashioned. The three course a la cart dinner menu was excellent. 10/10 would definitely go here again.
Wild Honey St James,1,9-May-23,5,"The ambience was lovely.
Michelin restaurant so the portion was small but excellent. The sauce was to die for.
Our server Vicky was great, very attentive.
We were celebrating our anniversary so they surprised us with dessert.
Definitely would go back."
Wild Honey St James,1,14-Mar-23,3,"A bit disappointed unfortunately - on a Saturday night, the restaurant was half empty so the vibe was a bit off. Service was OK, they were attentive but slow and we didn't get to have our dessert before having to leave for the next scheduled event of the night (which we had told them that we had to go and asked if they could bring the dessert out but there must have been a miscommunication because they ended up just taking it off our bill). Food was good but not inspired, probably wouldn't go back."
Wild Honey St James,1,12-Jan-23,2,"Not impressed at all. Wild Honey was one of the restaurants with a Michelin star that we chose to eat at on our vacation. We specifically chose it due to its proximity to the West End, and the fact that they had a pre-show dinner menu. That didn't work.

- It was freezing outside. London was experiencing a very cold December. When we arrived and told the individual at the desk that we had a reservation, she sat us at a table quite near the door. I'd like to point out that the restaurant kind of has two layers to it. An area near the door, and an ""upper"" area that seemed much more cozy and away from the door. We were literally the only people sitting in this area near the door letting in the freezing cold air, right next to the welcome desk.

- Despite being right next to the front door and the hostess, we were effectively forgotten. It took them ages to take our order, and it took them ages to bring out each course. Eventually a man walked by and saw us sitting at our table with no drinks and no food and said, ""I'm sorry. Have you all been helped? And are you in a hurry?"" We said we were very much in a hurry and we were this-close to bailing on our dinner. He was pretty horrified and got us our food as soon as. I am thankful for this man. The hostess came and offered a weird, patronizing apology, like she was speaking to a child in kindergarten.

- Even with all that? The food wasn't good. I am amazed they have a Michelin star. My experience with Michelin star restaurants is that if you have a pretty dining room, charge a lot of money, and present your food well - you'll receive a Michelin star. Wild Honey's food just wasn't very good. I had a stew which tasted like something I could easily make. I also had a pate dish that was inundated with anise.

After all this, Wild Honey had the audacity to charge us for our experience. I paid the bill and got the hell out of there. We had to anyway because we were running late for our show.

Caveat emptor."
Wild Honey St James,1,17-Dec-22,3,"I was so excited to make their early/pre-theater dinner part of our West End day. But I shouldn't have been. I didn't find the food to be particularly outstanding. It was fine, but nothing I would write home about. I'm only writing about it here because, well, that's what Yelp is for. The plating was so odd- my fish was served lukewarm on a hot, hot plate and in a way that made it impossible to put all components into the same bite. My partner's pork belly came in the saute pan with a plate on the side. I don't even really remember dessert unfortunately.

My biggest comment is on the service. We arrived before 5:30, and barely made our 7:30 show. We waited nearly 45 minutes between the first 2 courses which is rather absurd. The only reason we were able to be on time was because someone noticed us checking our watches and getting anxious. He was the 1 person on the wait staff who was friendly; the rest were just downright rude. I'm sorry I did not get his name but he saved our night.

We admittedly chased Michelin stars when making our dining plan, and the experience at Wild Honey showed us the error in doing so."
Wild Honey St James,1,11-Nov-22,5,"Service was great! The food was great as well, the chicken was ok, the pasta was superb. And the dessert- wow! The honey ice cream was such a unique flavor and the madeleines were so warm n fresh with a lemon filling inside"
Wild Honey St James,1,11-Sep-22,2,"We came here for lunch after visiting Buckingham Palace. I saw a ton of great reviews, so I expected a great experience. We ordered sangria and a honey based drink-- both drinks were ok, but not great. Our waitress was really bad though, she messed up our drinks and our orders. The food was just ok, nothing great. We had the quail -- which they gave us a butter knife to cut up--- not ideal. The plates were stoneware pottery so the too dull butter knives screeched every time you tried to use them and the whole restaurant turned to look. LOL it was a disaster. I would not go back there again."
Wild Honey St James,1,30-Jul-22,5,"Fantastic!

Wonderful food and service. The tasting menu was outstanding with well-chosen wine pairings. I thought the halibut course was sublime. A great experience that was worth every pence.

I highly recommend Wild Honey."
Wild Honey St James,1,13-May-22,5,"Came here for a work dinner and they had great ambiance.

We ordered a couple of snacks to share - cheese croquette and a couple of salami. I honestly loved all of them!

The eel starter was not my favorite, but the veal main was amazing. Tender, perfectly cooked, and paired well with the jus and sides.

Oh, and dont skip on the dessert! The wild honey ice cream served with fresh honeycomb is

Definitely a solid choice for dinner. I saw they had a pre theater menu as well which looked really good!"
Bancone,Bib,20-Jul-24,4,"I've now been to most of the Bib Gourmand Italian spots in London, and Bancone is really good. I loved the fried artichoke; the sauce brought so much flavor without distracting from the guilty pleasure of a fried artichoke. The signature item, the hankerchiefs, had amazing flavor. Enjoyed all of the plates, which were sized right for a three course meal. Service was good.

Only note was that the Negroni, while priced nicely, was really small. Would appreciate if they were on the larger side. Regardless, would absolutely come back."
Bancone,Bib,19-Jul-24,5,The food was delicious and the staff were lovely. It was wonderful to enjoy a dinner in London that was exceptional for a reasonable price.
Bancone,Bib,14-Jul-24,5,This was an incredible meal for a reasonable price in our opinion. We ordered the Hankerchief Pasta and it was one of the best things I've ever eaten. Delicious spot.
Bancone,Bib,24-Jun-24,5,"Amazing pasta!!!!! And so well priced.
Highly recommend this place! Also michelin star"
Bancone,Bib,23-Jun-24,1,"Waiter so mean and they don't do take away containers... did not tell us until after our meal when we asked for boxes. Who doesn't do take out??)?!! So wasteful and horrible. Pasta was oily, greasy, and not good. Cauliflower salad was horrendous."
Bancone,Bib,22-Jun-24,1,"Rude hostess who wouldn't seat us as soon as she saw we had children in our party. It was obvious because she was about to see us before she saw my kids and quickly changed her mind. She said they had a reservation that was already 10 minutes late but had to continue waiting another 15 minutes which made no sense. When I told her that she wasn't seating us because of the kids, she lost her mind. And said that she has kids too and they seat kids all the time. One look around the restaurant completely negated her statement. Not a kid in sight!! She was rude and disrespectful to 5 potential customers. If you are in the area check out BUCA DE LUPO which was packed and extremely kind to us, especially my kids and had excellent food and service."
Bancone,Bib,28-May-24,5,"Outstanding! Two tips:
1. No reservation? Ask if there is space at the community tables.
2. Get the silk scarves pasta dish! We cannot stop thinking about it. Wow."
Bancone,Bib,2-May-24,4,"5 stars on the food, but service left a lot to be desired. The price was super reasonable for the quality of food."
Bancone,Bib,20-Apr-24,4,"Bancone has the appearance of an upscale and fancy restaurant, but many of the diners came in dressed very casually. The menu is simple and we enjoyed the grilled artichoke as a starter. The pasta dishes we ordered were also tasty, but the walnut butter was a bit on the heavy side. The staff were nice and kind. Overall, this was a great pre musical dinner for my wife and me."
Bancone,Bib,22-Mar-24,3,"The ambiance and service were great and it was easy to get a seat alone at the bar. The drinks are also delicious. However, I was surprised by my disappointment with the food. I had high expectations given its on Michelin guide and was recommended by a friend. I was especially excited for the handkerchief, walnut butter, and confit egg yolk but I found it to be too bland. The texture of the pasta was great and clearly made very well. I also had the brown shrimp, keta caviar, anchovy cream, and fettuccine. I expected it to have a seafood flavor but it tasted way too fishy for my taste. The shrimp and caviar were fine but I felt that there was too much anchovy cream. The portions were also fairly small given I had two pastas to myself."
Bancone,Bib,3-Feb-24,4,"Went here after my Master's graduation because I'd heard really good things. I got the silk handkerchiefs, my mom got the ravioli, and my dad got the venison. Each dish was good, simple, and straightforward. Honestly, it might have been a little *too* simple for me, but still good nonetheless."
Bancone,Bib,6-Jan-24,4,"Bancone has been one of our favorite restaurants thus far in London!


Ambiance (5/5): Online the ambiance is described as ""upscale"" but I disagree. It's a casual pasta bar where most of their tables are counter top seating. We loved sitting along the kitchen as we got to see how the Chef's cooked each dish. We had both a dinner and show which we truly appreciated!

Service (2/5): Service does not exist here! We were actually very disappointed with the service as I had to constantly hound our waitress for water. She didn't check up on us not once to see how our meal was going and when it came to getting the check, we waited over 15 minutes until we gave up and called her over. Additionally, we waited over 30 minutes for our food to come out which we will give them the pass only because everything was made fresh.

Food (4.5/5): Their pasta was very delicious and for sure memorable! We ordered the Silk Handkerchiefs, Spicy Pork Ragu, and Brill Seaweed Butter Paccheri. As someone who doesn't typically order Ragu at Italian restaurants, I can say this was probably one of the best I have had. The meat portion was generous and the flavors just blended so well. I also loved the Silk Handkerchiefs, it's similar to a carbonara. I loved the nuttiness mixed with creamy taste inside each bite. Lastly, if the Brill Paccheri wasn't drenched in olive oil, I think it may have been my favorite dish of the night. Sadly, there was wayyy too much olive oil causing the pasta to get soaked in it (taking a 0.5 star off because of this). I can tell the flavors were there if they had used less oil--- the use of fish and pasta was iconic and unique. Overall, the pasta was cooked to perfection, it was not too hard and not too soggy. Bravo!

*** UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR: On the menu it states ""an optional gratuity of 12.5% will be added to the total bill"". However, when the bill came out the gratuity was already added to the total? As someone who is big on principle, if you want to charge 12.5% gratuity to all bills, fine. Just don't say it's optional when it's not and don't force customer to ask for the ""optional"" gratuity charge to be removed. Let the customer choose if they want to add it - that makes it truly optional***


As someone who is a food snob, I highly recommend visiting Bancone! Don't expect much from their service but their food will not disappoint."
Bancone,Bib,3-Jan-24,5,"Went here for my birthday and it was amazing. The food was delicious, I couldn't tell you a favorite but all their pasta is cooked to perfection.
The portions are pretty generous as well.
Try their signature cocktails, small servings but packs a punch!"
Bancone,Bib,29-Dec-23,3,"Solid but not great nor worth the hype. Party vibe, well lit establishment in the heart of the action. We had reservations and walk ups were getting turned away for the night (but we also noticed a bunch of two top tables available around 7pm). Seated promptly. Some delay for drink and food order, server seemed surprised we wanted it in sequence (not all at once). Starters were not great, dry focaccia and prosciutto, cauliflower salad was bizarre and had clumps of a mayo like
substance and was dying for a citrus or acid. Negroni selection was good but they are small. Wine selection limited which was a little odd. Pasta quality was high, venison and cacio e Pepe were best selections. Skip the spicy pork. More service delays. Desserts were fine, served ahead of coffee. There are much better Italian or pasta focused restaurants."
Bancone,Bib,2-Dec-23,5,"What an experience. What a dinner. Call for a reservation and ask to be seated where the action is. Tableside. Chef was absolutely in the zone and it was awesome to see the consistency of the food being pushed out real time.

We sampled three pasta dishes. Because we can. We were not disappointed. I wish we could have ordered all the dishes to try. The service was amazing. The staff was kind and chef....beast. Negroni was good. Dessert. Everything. We just couldn't help watching the food being platted. The way chef tasted dishes and how effortless he made it seem plating. Also, you would never guess he was on full display because he is so in the zone.

I would return in a heartbeat.

Y'all. Don't forget to thank chef on the way out. While you might think you're disturbing chef, you're not. A simple ""thank you chef"" is enough. Give credit where credit is due."
Bancone,Bib,4-Nov-23,5,Wowwwww. HIGHLY recommend this pasta spot in London. I was very skeptical having been in Italy last year but this place absolutely measured up. Handmade pasta at a super reasonable price every single dish I ordered was incredibly delicious. Service was FABULOUS and full of knowledge and recommendations. We walked in for an early dinner with no problems and were immediately seated but the later it got the busier it got. A absolutely worth it though. Will dream of it until I'm able to return!
Bancone,Bib,31-Oct-23,4,"Bancone is a casual place in central London. I liked the atmosphere of the place. Quality of pasta was great.
Only thing ..service could be a bit faster."
Bancone,Bib,28-Sep-23,5,"Food here is great. Ambiance is quite pleasant, with a bar feeling, but more private. The young man served us was in very good manner and introduced the food precisely."
Bancone,Bib,29-Aug-23,4,"Overall, awesome atmosphere. I came in the summer when the weather was nice so the front of the restaurant opened up to the street which was nice. I loved the open concept of the kitchen and bar also. We had a reservation and they seated us almost as soon as we got there. We ordered the famous silk handkerchief pasta. It was good, with hazelnut butter and confit egg yolk, however, the burrata and tomato appetizer left a lot to be desired. Both dishes needed a little acid, but the appetizer was begging for it. There was red onions mixed with the chopped tomato which made it more reminiscent of a salsa than an Italian tomato burrata dish. Interesting. Also, it came after our mains. Overall, for the price point, I felt the pasta was worth trying, but the appetizer was not and was disappointing."
Bancone,Bib,20-Aug-23,4,"Bancone has three locations and as one of London's best Italian pasta restaurants, Bancone is a casual and easy spot though recommendations are recommended for prime hours

Their menu focuses on classic Negroni cocktails and simple pastas for an unbeatable combination

We started off with the delightful focaccia bread and their signature burrata which they sell over 35,000 orders of annually

As for the pastas, each was perfectly al dente and the duck ragu, cacio e pepe and anchovy cream tagliatelle were our faves

Rosemary and Sea Salt Focaccia £4 / Burrata, tomato, basil, crispy fregola £11.5 / Silk handkerchiefs, walnut butter, confit egg yolk £11 / Bucatini Cacio e Pepe £12 / Scottish Mussels, Anchovy Cream Tagliatelle / Duck Ragù, fazzoletti, crackling £17 / Orange Blossom Negroni £7 / White Bancone Signature Negroni £7

"
Bancone,Bib,18-Aug-23,5,"Highly recommended , food is soooo goood, decor very modern and clean , server is super !"
Bancone,Bib,12-Aug-23,5,"We were recommended Bancone by a friend who frequents London. We got the Burrata, Focaccia, Handkerchiefs, Duck, Cacio e Pepe, and a couple cocktails. DIVINE. The pasta was fresh and the flavors were delicious, without being overpowering. We had a couple picky eaters in our group, and they loved it so much, that we ordered a second round of Handkerchiefs and Cacio e Pepe . The service was very attentive and everything came out well timed and warm. It felt very comfortable, where we could eat after running around all day, but not so upscale, where we felt out of place at any point in our day clothes. I cannot recommend Bancone more."
Bancone,Bib,6-Jul-23,5,"Bancone has been on my list of restaurants to try for some time and it didn't disappoint. We had the focaccia starter, and I had the silk handkerchiefs with egg and walnut. The handkerchiefs were lovely and unlike most pasta dishes I've had in town.

My friend had the beef cheeks pasta, which I didn't try but he finished his plate and said it was delicious!

I would definitely recommend a reservation. We stopped in about 6pm on a Sunday and we're quoted an 1.5 hour wait for walk-in. Luckily the wait was only 45 minutes and the hostess was extra attentive to ensure she could reach me on my US phone number when our seats were ready.


"
Bancone,Bib,18-Jun-23,5,"Fabulous hand made delicious food. Good prices too, but we did wait about 40 minutes for our first course. Maybe a bit precious in their own minds?"
Bancone,Bib,17-Jun-23,3,"This was the place my husband was the place where my husband was most excited to dine while we were in London last month. We went for lunch when it wasn't to crowded. The space is nice and the service was top notch but the food was honestly kind of meh. As you can see their famous silk handkerchief pasta photographed beautifully but was a little too one note for me. We ordered the grilled artichoke to start and then the silk handkerchief pasta, kale rigatoni and spicy pork mafalde. We overordered because there were so many dishes that we were excited to try! The grilled artichoke was my favorite dish, it was very fresh and the romesco it came with really packed a punch. The pastas were all cooked perfectly Al dente but the flavor just wasn't there for me. The ones that were supposed to be spicy could have used more pizzaz. Overall a little disappointed but still a lovely experience."
Bancone,Bib,7-Jun-23,5,A casual and lively spot for great pasta in central London. Highly recommended!!
Bancone,Bib,18-May-23,5,"Everything at this restaurant was absolutely delicious! The inside it a bit tight size wise and they do have set time allotments for each reservation size. We had counter seating, which was a great spot to watch them make all the dishes. Both our appetizers were very well executed. I thoroughly enjoyed the burrata with the salt baked beet root. I would highly recommend the silk handkerchief for the main dish! It seemed to be one of the most popular items and did not disappoint. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was divine! I've never had pasta quite like it. Also have to give a shout-out to the chocolate dessert. We even got a second because we like it so much!"
Bancone,Bib,30-Apr-23,5,"Our favorite meal in London.

We ordered the silk handkerchiefs with egg and walnut, Seaweed butter & mackerel, and celeriac rigatoni for entrees. We also ordered the cod roe dip for app. The dip was very flavorful and the standout was the seaweed butter and mackerel! I have never had a dish like that before and would recommend it if you like seafood.

All the pasta is handmade and overall I think this place is worthy of their bib gourmand selection. Make a reservation!"
Bancone,Bib,23-Apr-23,5,"Very great food. It seemed pack from the outside, and when we talked to the host, she was super nice and actually gave us two options of tables. We sat upstairs and the room was great. More private, quiet than downstairs but definitely not uncomfortable.
Everyone loved their food. I had the cacio e Pepe and chocolate dessert. My party had the handkerchiefs and spicy pork mafalde. Everyone finished their plates.
Great little place to randomly stumble upon and definitely worth the recommendation!"
Palomar,Bib,25-Jul-24,4,"During a recent London downpour, I took shelter in The Palomar (with a pre-planned reservation). It was a really great Middle Eastern/Mediterranean meal; with starting with the fluffy and filling kubaneh together with the labneh. The sesame chicken schnitzel followed, leading up to the tarka octopus. Flavors on everything were outstanding, as was the presentation. Service was really good as well, and it was set up nicely for a single diner.

The meal closed with an ice cream sandwich which had me really excited, as the ""cookies"" are baklava. Unfortunately, the baklava was a bit plain, and didn't deliver much sweetness. I also thought the price point was on the higher end for a Bib Gourmand, given the smallness of the plates. Still, The Palomar greatly expanded my horizons of Middle Eastern food, and I'd gladly return.

"
Palomar,Bib,23-Jun-24,4,Very good food and service ; chicken is a standout ; good cocktails; great ambiance and location;
Palomar,Bib,10-Jun-24,5,"Loved this place. So small and different from any other Mediterranean type restaurant in the best way possible. All the dishes were amazing and incredibly delicious. We split everything per our waitstaff's recommendation.
If in London, get a reservation ( required) and go here.
You will be so pleased"
Palomar,Bib,23-May-24,5,"Had an impromptu meal here after seeing a matinee around the corner, having had Palomar recommended to us by some friends. Host was gracious enough to offer us two corner bar seats with the promise we'd only be 90 minutes or so. We were warmly greeted by Will, one of the barkeeps. In addition to fetching us a 1/2 carafe of nice, reasonable Chianti, he ran through the menu, including favorites and recommendations. We placed orders for bread, salad, and a tartare with no pressure to quickly select a main. The bread, a Yemeni kubaneh, was fresh out of the over and lighter, but just as delicious as a good brioche. To go with it we ordered a labneh drizzled with oil and topped with za'atar and pistachios. The Palamar salad was equally nice, the tartare quite good, and the chicken--richly spiced and sitting in a pool of labaniah, drizzled with orange spice oil--was amazing. We quickly met other servers behind the bar--Dionne and Shia--both of whom were super attentive, friendly, and quick to share stories and ask questions. The space itself is mostly taken up with a long bar, with a few tables at both the front end and more in the back. If you like to cook, you can request bar seats overlooking the kitchen area, which is what we will do next time in London. We finished our meal with their ice cream 'sandwich'--pistachio ice cream layered between two thin but rich, crisp layers of baklava. Overall, an exceptional meal."
Palomar,Bib,23-May-24,5,One of the best meals we had our entire trip! The tahini was the best I've ever had!! Even our kids couldn't get enough. Don't miss out on this hidden gem. Tiny but mighty.
Palomar,Bib,5-May-24,5,Hoy me quedé muy sorprendido dela atención y la comida tan deliciosa que sirven en Palomar ..el pulpo esta muy rico y la arrachera bien suavecita en fin todo perfecto les recomiendo este lugar y no les va a defraudar..y las margarita son de lo mejor..le doy un 10..
Palomar,Bib,3-Apr-24,5,"Whenever we find ourselves in London The Palomar is an absolute must go to for dinner - and it never fails. All the dips and bread, ribeye, the beet salad was phenomenal with mint, orange and horseradish BUT the show stopper this time was the chicken main entree. We are not ones to regularly order chicken when we're out to dinner but our lovely server recommended it and we thankfully took her advice. Sit at the counter and enjoy the interaction and show. You will never be disappointed."
Palomar,Bib,23-Nov-23,5,"The Palomar was a last minute dining to decision for us, and boy are we glad we 1) were able to get a reservation, and 2) able to find this hidden gem!

The restaurant is on the smaller side, and while we have only been there once, I can imagine the place is usually pretty packed as it was the night we went for dinner during our travels in London. After we were initially looking to go elsewhere for dinner but were turned away because we didn't have a reservation, we found this place and a last minute reservation (the only one left for the night; must've been a late cancellation) that we were able to slide into. So grateful we did!

The server we had really made the experience. I cannot remember his name, but he was a kind gentlemen who walked us through the menu, made drink and food recommendations, and was attentive throughout our time there. The drinks list was creative and I enjoyed each of the two cocktails I tried. The food itself was incredible. I highly recommend doing what my fiancé and I did - sharing a few appetizers and small plates together, vs. the traditional order separate entrees. I will particularly call out the breads and dips our server recommended (especially the white one, which I think was a feta cheese based dip). The steak was also incrediblely flavorful and cooked to perfection.

If we ever get the chance to come back, we certainly would!"
Palomar,Bib,28-Oct-23,5,"We entered into a mostly empty restaurant @ 12:30; by the time we left it was hopping.

3 types of bread. The Kubaneh was too cakey, but the pita was warm, freshly baked and unique. We opted for the humus and ""spicy experience"". The seabass tartare was fresh and had a zing. Mackerel was savory. For dessert we opted for the Tahini tart.

The friendly & helpful staff helped to select our options. The combo was fabulous. I would def return."
Palomar,Bib,28-Oct-23,5,"Absolutely brilliant!! If I lived in London, I'd be at The Palomar weekly.

We enjoyed such a lovely dinner here. Everything about this place is 5 STAR. The energy is intoxicating in the best way. The vibes were spot on from the moment we stepped through the door until the second we left. High frequency bustling energy = my fav type of energy.

I usually don't comment on staff appearances but this team is smokin' hot! I dare you not to notice.

We didn't have a booking and stopped in a bit after 21:30 on a Thursday evening. We were seated within ten minutes. Make a booking to be safe, we just lucked out.

My bestie and I both took note of the menu and loved how they listed everyone's names down the center. This spoke to us before food or drinks even hit the table. It's such a thoughtful shout out to the people who put the work in to create such a wonderful experience. We didn't sit at the kitchen bar but I can see how that would be a fun spot too, not a bad seat in the place.

I had the spicy Paloma. It was so good, I could have had two! This bourbon girl also LOVES tequila. The spiced fig old fashioned was calling my name, I'll have to have it next time.

We shared the Chicken Schnitzel, Kubaneh, Labneh, Hummus and Ribeye. We had ordered the carrots but somehow they didn't make it out to us, which was no problem at all. We'd just flown in from France and had chicken with carrots for lunch, so we were not carrot deficient ;) We were plenty satisfied with our selections. Everything was mouth watering delish.

We had a couple desserts on the house which was very sweet of them. The sorbet and ice cream sandwiches.

We also shared a port, and two additional brownie bites arrived.

I'd fly back to London this week just to dine at Palomar, it's that perfect.

Highly recommend."
Palomar,Bib,25-Oct-23,5,Very much enjoyed our meal here! The ambiance is very relaxing and classy and the service was very kind. The starters are decent though perhaps not the most stunning example of hummus or falafel I've had for the price; however the mains are stunning! I had the slow roasted carrots and I'll dream of them for years to come -- highly recommend trying as many of the mains as you can!
Palomar,Bib,14-Oct-23,5,"Memorable, phenomenal food; great service. Reservations a must. Sit at bar at front window."
Palomar,Bib,5-Oct-23,5,"We were fortunate to get an early dinner reservation on our 2nd to last night in London. This was our favorite restaurant in our 3 week European tour.
Middle Eastern small plates in lower Soho area. Kiki, our server, delightfully helped navigate us through the unfamiliar menu. Started with Kubaneh bread and two hummus dips. Sesame chicken starter, followed by fattoush salad, oyster mushroom polenta and grilled chicken. The seasonings, preparation and quality were amazing! Kiki recommended a Chablis that perfectly paired with our meal. We finished with
""Jerusalem Mess"" and a recommended Sauterne.
Heavenly."
Palomar,Bib,3-Oct-23,5,"Terrific food with delicious sauces, spices and vegetables accompanying every dish. We were lucky to get a reservation!"
Palomar,Bib,29-Sep-23,5,This is a hidden gem in soho! It's a small restaurant that specializes in Mediterranean food- small plates smile! Their hummus and labne are super tasty and the chicken schnitzel was excellent. Also the courgettes and smashed cucumbers were excellent compliments to the main dishes. Basically - there was not a dish that I didn't love. They have great cocktails as well- the fig old fashioned being one of my faves. Make reservations early as they tend to book up but you must check this one out if you're in London!
Palomar,Bib,8-Sep-23,5,"One of the tips I got before my London trip was that I should get some Middle Eastern food here. I'm staying in Covent Garden and found Palomar in the Michelin Guide. I came here for lunch on a Friday afternoon and was nicely seated at the counter in front of the grill.

The server recommended that I try the trio of dips (labneh, hummus and babaganush) and the kubaneh to start. The kubaneh was just amazing - it's an airy Yemeni bread that paired really well with all of the dips. I was torn between the lamb and the octopus but decided to go with octopus. It was really nice and tender and all the sauces in the plate just blended well. For dessert, I ordered the lemon and arak sorbet since it was hot and humid outside. I had the sirocco for my non-alcoholic pairing and that was great as well.

This was just the perfect lunch on a vacation trip and cost £67. The counter seats at the restaurant were the best and I really enjoyed the music playing in the background. Highly recommended if you are in the area and just craving some good Middle Eastern food."
Palomar,Bib,9-May-23,5,"Must Try: Lamb Skewers
TLDR; High class service and exemplary food in a casual space

The menu - The Palomar has a variety of amazing modern Jerusalem dishes, we tried almost everything on the menu and there was nothing we didn't want more of. You can't go wrong so just pick anything that sounds good to you! The lamb skewers are particularly amazing.

The staff - The servers behind the counter were attentive and friendly and even chatted us up about other places we could try and restaurants we were looking at for dinner (after lunch at Palomar). They knew everything about the menu and gave us tips on great things to pair."
Palomar,Bib,7-May-23,5,"Lovely lunch at the bar. We enjoyed the polenta, labneh and crab kofte. The drinks were also great. Watching the chefs as you eat is also fun."
Palomar,Bib,5-Mar-23,5,"Great ambiance, friendly staff and amazing food! Book in advance and try the Persian Chicken. If you are looking for non alcoholic drinks, their mock tails are really good as well"
Kricket,Bib,18-Jun-24,5,"Very tasty experience in a cosy setting. Every dish was a treat for your taste buds (the fried chicken definitely being a highlight - try dunking it in the vegetarian take on 'butter chicken'). Only caveat is you'll be kicked out at 11pm (like at many places in London), even with a late reservation (ours was at 9:30pm). Experience would've even been better if we weren't seated at a long 'picknick' table right alongside (and in the social bubbles of) other guests."
Kricket,Bib,14-Jun-24,5,Fabulous food! Best meal in London. Loved trying so many different things. Highly recommend!
Kricket,Bib,3-Jun-24,5,"So many people told me to go here and I wondered how could it could actually be so I went on my trip to London.
Everyone was correct. The food here was phenomenal. I actually recommend sitting at the top floor high chairs because you can see them making your food and it is very entertaining. Everyone here was extremely kind and they were very attentive to us. The menu has option for vegetarians and everything is rich in flavor. Their chai is very good and they have good beer options as well. Our absolute favorite thing we got was the fish curry. This was my favorite meal we had on our visit to London thanks Kricket!!"
Kricket,Bib,7-Apr-24,3,"Not impressed. I had pretty high expectations of this place. The appetizer was fine, but I had the chickpea small dish and the grilled lamb, both of which were meh. And their naan is also meh."
Kricket,Bib,7-Apr-24,1,"Came here last night. I don't understand why this restaurant is so highly rated. The food is awful and the place is noisy, basic and chaotic. We received at least three things we didn't order and we were missing a couple of dishes that we did. I felt we were encouraged to over-order, so I did try quite a few things on their very limited menu.staff were nice but clearly harassed by the sheer number of customers and extreme tightness of space at the communal banquettes downstairs.

Snacks:
Mirchi vada - the best thing on the menu. Light and spicy. Gave me misplaced hope
Butter chicken kofta - also good, the snacks were the only good things on the menu.

Small plates
Samphire pakoras- tasteless. Avoid
Chana masala- chick peas with hummus. Really weird. Did not work
Lamb ribs - basically lamb fat, disgusting

Larger
Mutton curry- ok but very ordinary and bland
Smoked pork belly - inedible as way too salty
Dahl- utterly tasteless

Sides
Naan - ok but they initially have us some bread with green sludge all over it. Don't know what is was but it was soggy and horrible
Meera pulao - ok
Broccoli - possibly the worst thing we ate, but it's hard to choose. It was absolutely drowned in a 'walnut chutney' which was like an overpowering blue cheese sauce. Completely inedible

Desserts
Bhappa doi- a mishmash of all kinds of things which did not go together and tasted revolting
Mango and lime kulfi- not frozen. Much too sweet.

Obviously I am not returning.


Definitely does not merit the high prices."
Kricket,Bib,24-Dec-23,4,excellent food and creativity in the menu. lots of small bite appetizer plates. i sat at the bar and the service was pretty good as well.
Kricket,Bib,3-Nov-23,5,"Excellent, innovative food, service excellent. Music was too loud for us old folks but we adapted. I"
Kricket,Bib,20-Oct-23,3,"Excellent ambience and food, slightly unexpected bill. Clearly this is a place of distinction but keep in mind that your bill will have an additional 35% added to it after they add in a 15% discretionary charge and a 20% extra charge.

The vibe of this place is great. Subtle interior design, wonderful lighting, and great music. Kricket definitely makes a good impression.!

Food is mostly good. Fried chicken dish was cooked perfectly and a bit of interesting spice to it. Brown buttered naan was quite lovely. The daal dish was a bit strange and almost tasted gamey so we didn't have much of that. Cocktails were pleasant and subtle - just what was needed at about 4pm.

The ridiculous charges at the end of the meal were eye popping. I've never seen an upcharge on the meal in my entire life, and that includes many, many fine dining institutions and places of distinction. It wasn't good enough to warrant that."
Kricket,Bib,9-Oct-23,5,"Our favorite place we dined in!

They were able to accommodate 16 of us and our waiter was insanely kind/patient with our large group. He took the time to help us make the right decision with food recs and took our different dietary restrictions into consideration. There are also foods on the menu that are halal friendly.

We decided to go with ""A Taste Of Kricket"" to make it easy for a family style brunch. Our standout foods were: pistachio kulcha, grilled butternut squash, goan sausage croquette, and dark chocolate dessert. I would come back just for the kulcha and squash!

The cocktails were also very delicious. I ordered an espresso martini which was perfectly balanced with coffee and liquor. The North Of The River cocktail was my favorite on the menu."
Kricket,Bib,16-Sep-23,5,"So delicious and my husband is gluten free. When we first sat down, the helpful staff asked if there weee any food allergies, and she was completely helpful for him...ensuring he had an amazing meal while still staying well. I can't rave enough about this place with the devour, food and staff. Simply amazing!!!! We're lucky to have found it!"
Kricket,Bib,13-Sep-23,4,"Snagged a last minute 8:30 table and was welcomed with great customer service. Water was constantly coming. Servers were beyond knowledgeable and helpful. Perfect balance of attentive without feeling like they're kicking you out.

Started with Bhel Puri, an interesting rice dish. The fried chicken was super bland which is why I couldn't give a 5* rating.

Tenderstem Broccoli was a great surprise with an awesome sauce. Great texture since everything else was heavy.

The grilled lamb was a bit tough, but the sauce was a yummy balsamic which was perfect for the roti.

On the flip side, the fish curry was cooked to perfection.

Skip the dal. Very boring. We didn't even make it through half."
Kricket,Bib,21-Aug-23,5,"A delightful and amazing meal! We were fortunate to have theatre seating at the bar to watch all the magic happen! Chef Will Bowlby of Kricket Soho, offers a creative menu that features exceptional Indian flavors. And just as impressive as the food, the kitchen, bar and hospitality staff are a well oiled machine working together in harmony while keeping one of the cleanest and organized work spaces I have ever seen. We loved everything we ordered. Each of the small plates had a distinctly different flavor profile and we loved ALL of it! It was great talking to the chef and sous chefs during our meal, but watching Executive chef Will put his own final touch on absolutely every dish before it was delivered shows his passion and pride in his wonderful food! Everything is good, but don't miss the fried chicken, hake curry and the yogurt dessert. Bravo!!"
Kricket,Bib,24-Jun-23,5,"The most incredible ""Indian"" cuisine I've ever had. It is a mixture of traditional seasonings with a haute presentation. It's well worth the experience and expense. Everything on the menu is worth trying."
Kricket,Bib,1-Jun-23,5,"We had a great meal here! Awesome, friendly service, with very solid food. Would recommend overall!"
Kricket,Bib,27-May-23,5,"Amazing food, amazing service!
Highly recommend!
Can't wait to go back, the nuts were the best ever"
Kricket,Bib,5-Mar-23,5,"Very cozy and buzzy vibes in an unbeatable neighborhood and atmosphere. Hand crafted menu with amazing meat and vegetarian offerings - everything comes out quickly and pairs well together. I have to get the pakoras and pistachio naan every time. The cocktails don't disappoint either. The staff are knowledgeable and helpful but might rush you out to accommodate the next table.


"
Kricket,Bib,17-Feb-23,5,"Amazing flavors! Awesome staff, very friendly and accommodating. The place is small but intimate. I felt like I was visiting the chef in a special place, not just ordering, eating and leaving. Definitely try this place if you like a modern twist."
Kiln,Bib,21-Jul-24,3,"Loud, hot, cramped. Lovely server who was top notch. Food incredibly spicy and no option for toning it down. Couldn't discern flavors due to the spice. No typical Thai food and no noodles on this night. Not at all relaxing or enjoyable. Corkage was allowed, 30£. Pass on a return visit. If you go--check the menu first."
Kiln,Bib,11-Jul-24,4,"Solo for dinner in June: Really really good experience. People who work there were super; atmosphere and view sitting at the counter were terrific; clay pot noodles were outstanding and a treat, chicken was delicious, bavette was not good (mistake by me and should've known better...bavette is a shit cut - when sauced/spiced it'll have flavor, but was just difficult to eat jerky). Happy to tip, but what's with the ""optional""-but-not-optional 12.5% service charge?"
Kiln,Bib,30-Jun-24,5,"OMG. This place is amazing!!! Really excellent flavors and everything we had was delicious. Especially recommend the glass noodles. Would recommend ordering several dishes and sharing rather than having individual plates, as the options really do blend together well. Service was very friendly and efficient, reasonable prices for the quality of food. So happy this dinner was such a success!!"
Kiln,Bib,5-May-24,4,"Ambience is nice, food is delicious (especially the noodle) but the portion size could have been better.

Not sure about the hype but definitely worth of trying if you're a foodie and like trying south East Asian food."
Kiln,Bib,4-May-24,5,"Came by for lunch the other day and it was a world class experience! Kiln is a Thai restaurant located in the bustling Soho district and is featured in the Michelin guide as a Bib Gourmand. Made a reservation online and I was able to be seated upon arrival.

Dining is available at the kitchen counter, bar, or in the basement dining room. Managed to get a seat by the kitchen counter and it was a very warm experience sitting in front of the grill. Bring a mask if one is sensitive to spices!

The waitstaff were lovely and spent time explaining the menu that changes daily.

Started off with the chicken and soy along with the rump with ubon relish and they were both excellent. The chicken thigh was grilled to perfection and super flavorful from the marination. The rump was cooked to perfection at a medium rare and the flavors were on point. The chef that made this personally presented this to me at the counter. Amazing!

The glass noodles were fragrant and tasty. The crab portion was minimal and the pork belly had a smell to it...

~£30/head including VAT and service for lunch. Kiln takes credit cards and there was a £1 donation that was added to my bill which I requested them to remove..."
Kiln,Bib,18-Mar-24,4,"Service = good.

Ambiance = romantic & hipster, yet, casual at the same time.

Drinks = had 2 cocktails which were tasty but not strong. Glass size is smaller than what I'm use to. No garnish used on cocktails.

Food = Thai influenced but had a ""western"" flavor forward profile. Portions were very small but tasty, nonetheless.

12.5% auto gratuity and 1%(?) charge for something else on all bills"
Kiln,Bib,2-Mar-24,5,"Food was fantastic
Staff was super friendly and helpful.
Highly recommend it.
Make a reservation"
Kiln,Bib,5-Jan-24,5,"Burn baby burn...it was nice to be near fire in the cold of the winter. Oh and it doesn't hurt to have some good food along with it. Small menu, just try whatever and you'll be fine."
Kiln,Bib,28-Nov-23,5,"Phenomenal experience here. Had a bit of a wait so popped out to a nearby pub. Worth the wait. Got the laap sausage, slow grilled chicken, raw mutton, grilled rump cap, ox heart, glass noodles, and brown rice. All were great and almost all were fairly spicy, ranging from 4-7. The mutton and ox heart were the spiciest but went well with rice. The chicken was the best, had to go in for seconds. Glass noodles were great too. Everything we had was great, would definitely come back to try more.

Vibes were fantastic. Fitting for the name, if you sit on the first floor it's all bar seating and you can see the prep line with big flames and clay pots. All in a dark setting with UK grime blasting in the back. Downstairs vibe is more chill, much more lighting with proper tables. Would recommend first floor bar seating if your party is small enough."
Kiln,Bib,24-Nov-23,5,"Great: citrus salad, pork sausage, Jin toob, roasted chicken, clay pot glass noodle, stirred fried veggies
Meh: lamb chop
Don't try unless you really want to: turmeric & ginger lemonade, curry pollock"
Kiln,Bib,2-Oct-23,2,We had 5 plates of various food. Except for the chicken marinated in soy sauce and spices it was some of the worst tasting food I have ever had at a restaurant. Some of the dishes were not edible. It seems Very strange that Kiln has such high reviews.
Kiln,Bib,26-Sep-23,4,"Was jazzed to check this place out after seeing the great reviews. Overall, the food was good and the service was attentive. It was jammed packed on a Thursday evening.

Would highly recommend getting a reservation if you want to check it out. The dishes are super flavourful. A bit pricey but given the area, should be expected.

I'd be willing to come back again!"
Kiln,Bib,22-Jun-23,5,"Great low key place! Not the Thai I'm used to having, but I still really liked it. The 'chicken and soy' dish was my personal favorite. We got to sit at the bar right where they cooked our food! W experience. Definitely suggest trying to sit at the bar next to the kitchen. It was cool to watch the cooks in action. They only serve for a limited time so be sure to get there quick! We were the last group of eaters and we ate around 3-3:30. Overall (as the kids say) 'hip' place."
Kiln,Bib,18-Jun-23,3,"To be fair, compare to the take out Thai place that open til 2am in the morning, this is way better. But if you're looking for amazing Thai food and pay a decent amount, this is not it.

We ordered literally the entire menu. Not only did nothing really wow us, the price was not exactly nice either.

Most of the food is either not big enough to share or it tasted very bland. The more flavorful dishes are waaaaaay too spicy and we are the kind of people who have experience Asian spicy in asia.

I mean don't get me wrong - it's not the worst Thai food but I guess I have too much expectation for it to be flavorful.

We booked 3 months in advance to get a table on a Friday night so it's not exactly somewhere you can just pop by.

On top of that, there's no dessert at all."
Kiln,Bib,2-Jun-23,3,"I came in with high expectations and left feeling a bit disappointed. In a vacuum, the food tastes good, but I felt the restaurant missed on a few executions. Considering its price point, I'm hesitant to go back.

What went well: the stir fried Cornish greens with soy. A very cool aspect about the restaurant setup is that many seats are seated by the open kitchen, and I particularly enjoyed watching the flames and stir fry. There's a certain ""spirit of the wok"" (""wok hei"" 锅气 in Cantonese) that, when imparted into veggie stir fry, is incredible. This was one of those hits.

Unfortunately, that was the only standout. For some of the other dishes, the flavour (and textures) just don't come together:
1/ Langoustines with green strawberry and mint felt like a random assembly with no clear narrative, and the langoustine meat was hard to pick out. Also, there was nowhere to discard the langoustine shells.
2/ The spicy red curry (forgot the fish) did not contain strong seafood umami as I'd expect! The fish is only plated into the curry a few moments before serving, meaning the natural flavour of the fish doesn't get much time to seep in. The fish also comes with bones too, be warned.
3/ Each diner only gets a small plate that isn't switched out before courses. This is rather inconvenient because: (a) how does one eat curry from a small plate (not bowl), and (b) where do the discarded bones/shells etc. go? Form over function was unfortunately a recurring theme throughout the meal."
Kiln,Bib,8-Apr-23,5,Perfection! The ambiance from the bar is great. Every dish is light and flavorful. Worth the try!
Kiln,Bib,29-Mar-23,5,Hella ya this place is the bomb food music atmosphere .. menu is different daily ! Damn 10 out of 10
Kiln,Bib,4-Mar-23,4,"I stopped here for lunch and I was delightfully surprised. The curries are flavorful and indeed spicy.

Although some mishaps in the dishes served, service was good. I got a dish that I did not order and they took the dish I originally ordered (which later arrived) and the wrong one off the bill.

The place is a little bit tight and probably sitting on the counter is your best option to see the kitchen at work. The ambiance, though, is that of a street food in Thailand after all."
Kiln,Bib,5-Feb-23,4,"Came for lunch - sat at the counter. Fast service, great flavor.

Laotian curry- herbal, fragrant. The fish was super tender and flavorful. It is quite spicy, the spice builds, so be warned!

Radish salad was really refreshing- not overdone.

The only dish I wasn't keen on was the clay pot with glass noodles. While the noodles were fine, you could hardly taste any crab meat. So that was disappointing.

Tip: they do take walk-ins for bar/kitchen counter seating. But try to come early. There was a line already even before the restaurant opened for lunch."
Berenjak,Bib,14-Jun-24,4,"Second time in a year, really good food but nothing special for a Michelin star restaurant. Had to book a few weeks before, hasn't changed much except for the new dessert that has soft serve included. They could do better with the kitchen staff wearing gloves and hair nets to be honest"
Berenjak,Bib,1-Jun-24,5,Food is amazing. We went with course menus and it was delicious. Service also is great. Highly recommend to book in advance since the place is always busy. Location next to the market makes it very trendy and cool. For sure next trip we visit this restaurant again.
Berenjak,Bib,12-Apr-24,5,My favorite dinner while traveling in London (2023). We opted for the tasting menu and chose the chicken and lamb kababs and enjoyed all of the different mezze options immensely. Trying the tasting menu let us explore options we might not have otherwise ordered. A meal I'll wish I could relive
Berenjak,Bib,13-Nov-23,5,Absolutely amazing! I showed up at 5:15 on a Monday night and lined up. They opened at 5:30 and they sat folks who had reservations and then I got a seat at the bar which was a great experience seeing all the action. I was immediately packed but organized. I ordered Persian white cocktail which was meh but then the food immediately caught up. I ordered kashk e bademjoon which was great and Olivier salad. I got a taftoon bread which they bake there fresh and you can watch them baking the bread. I ordered the lamb/ barreh for my entree that was also perfect. I ordered too much but also shared with the person sitting next to me at the bar. Keep it up Berenjak. I'll come back.
Berenjak,Bib,5-Nov-23,5,"I could eat here daily and I'd never get bored. The hummus!!! I mean all of it's just so so good. The staff are always beyond accommodating with dietary requirements. My husband & I live in New York City but are from England & Egypt and every time we come back to London this is our first stop. It's almost become a bit of a ritual.

James the manager is so wonderful and always remembers us. Can't recommend this place enough"
Berenjak,Bib,11-Oct-23,3,"I really wanted to like this place. Pricing was kind of ridiculous for the quality. The kebab was not tender & very elastic, and the service was almost nonexistent. They forgot to bring out a few things that we ordered and ended up having to cancel them. Didn't understand the hype at all, unfortunately disappointed."
Berenjak,Bib,10-Jul-23,4,Food was great!! The yogurt type dish was delish and the naan very tasty and toasty. Small place though not alot of room and must make a reservation.
Berenjak,Bib,23-Jun-23,5,"*Lunch special review*

3 courses for £28 and you will leave full and happy! We sat at the bar and that ended up being great because you can watch them making the food. It is very impressive and they are working hard. You choose from a dip (many options) with breads, a meat (lamb or chicken) and a side (either rice or salad). There is a lot of food, do this is a great deal. We loved everything we got! Service is great and food comes out quick."
Berenjak,Bib,3-Jun-23,5,"One of my new favorite spots. The fresh bread was absolutely incredible, as were the various sides. If I were to go back, I would try and get a variety of sides instead of mains, because everything seemed so unique and wonderful. The juicy chicken, the eggplant spread, the crispy rice, 10/10"
Berenjak,Bib,30-May-23,4,"Came here for a quick lunch before the play. Without reservation, only an outside seating was available so we took it. They have a small interior and some high top seats outside. Started with some kashke bademjaan and mirza ghasemi. They have fresh sangak or round bread which goes well with these apps, though unfortunately is not complementary. The quality of the skewers were out of this world. Super tender. Clearly marinated overnight. Absolutely tasty and delightful. My only missing star is because of the slow service. It took a while for them to get our order. Otherwise very delicious Persian meal. Highly recommend a try."
Berenjak,Bib,8-Apr-23,3,"One of those finicky places that can't decide if it wants to be high end or not. I checked in around 1:45 and it was an hour or so wait for lunch. They have a text system and their wait time quoted was pretty accurate. I came back and was able to be seated immediately at one of the stools adjacent to the bar. I ordered a glass of wine and some dips. Despite great bar seating the menu is definitely designed to be shared.

Prices are on the moderate to high side. Dips are around £8 each, breads £4, kebabs around £20. With that said, I found that the quality of the food matched the prices. The balal (£7) aka corn on the cob was unbelievably good. The hummus (£7.50) was unbeatable. The mast o musir (£7.50) was missable. The bread was great.

Service was fine but pretty impersonal. One of those rare instances where the service fee seems a bit of a farce.

Docking at least a star because the toilets (only two for the whole restaurant) were vile - one was completely clogged, the other was missing toilet paper and the waste basket was overflowing. A complete embarrassment for any restaurant.

Overall I was a bit disappointed and wouldn't rush to recommend."
Berenjak,Bib,21-Mar-23,1,"They sat a party that didn't have reservations ahead of us and ignored our request to be seated sooner since we were already there. Then they offered us seats at the bar instead. When asking the host how he could seat people who didn't have reservations ahead of us, he claimed that those people had reservations. That was a blatant lie since we were present when they were telling the host that they DID NOT have reservations. Cannot say anything about the food but I can say that dishonesty and deceit are not signs of perfection or a dedication to any culinary perfection. Zero is what they are going to get from me. I left 100.00 pounds on the counter for them to keep as the price for their dishonesty. They will never have anything more from me."
Berenjak,Bib,5-Mar-23,5,"My husband and I make it a point to look for Persian restaurants anytime we travel and wow, Berenjak did not disappoint! The restaurant is so beautiful inside and the staff were all great! But that's not even the best part -- the food is out of this world! I mean, I have a higher set of standards when it comes to kabobs and middle eastern food in general, but man, this place is easily in the top 5 category. We ordered the chicken, beef, and liver kabobs and they were all mouthwatering-delicious!"
Berenjak,Bib,11-Feb-23,5,"This restaurant was unbelievable! The people were so kind. The food was phenomenal. It had the best corn, chicken salad, and lamb I've ever had in my life! Will absolutely be coming back and recommending it to many. Has many gluten free and vegetarian options."
Berenjak,Bib,4-Dec-22,5,"I have eaten at Berenjak about seven times in the last year and it never disappoints. The atmosphere is lively (sit at the counter if you can), the staff is friendly, and the food....ahhhhh, the food. Perfectly cooked bread, succulent kebabs, rich hummus, fresh mint/dill/walnut/feta/radish....there is nothing here that is even close to subpar. Get a reservation and bring an appetite!"
Berenjak,Bib,29-Oct-22,3,"Arrived 5min early for an 830pm dinner on a Friday. The place was a zoo, staff moving around furiously. After checking in at the front we were seated at the hightop bar. Super excited to try my second Persian kabob joint in London.

We started off w/ cocktails (the tahini old fashioned and a gin fizz sharbat) and ordered a few dips (mast Khiyar, kashk bademjoon, mast moosir and salad shirazi). We also ordered the sangak bread which was super light & crispy. We were hoping for a less hectic ambiance and felt rushed to get in/out.

For the mains we ordered the koobideh, jujeh tond (spicy chicken on the bone), and the ghorme sabzi.

The ghorme sabzi comes poured out of a sealed plastic bag and warmed. The koobideh was too gelatinous for my liking and had a strange texture to it. The jujeh tond was really good as was the ghorme sabzi.

They don't do traditional rice w their entrees so make sure to order rice. Also, the tadig isn't traditional but is like shaved into a powder which I assume is to mask it's not fresh.

Overall, was looking forward to a Bib Gourmand Persian restaurant but was let down. It appears the Brit's don't have taste buds for Persian cuisine. Pretty much anyplace in the states has this place beat."
Berenjak,Bib,10-Aug-22,5,"We heard a lot about this Persian restaurant!got reservations for one& half hour dinner at6.00 pm. The ambiance is very nice, modern, welcoming. Ordered mastomosir, kashkobademjan, mirzaghasemi, salad Shirazi all were delicious but the only problem they don't bring everything at the same time& portions are very small. The bread they make is so yummy. We tried barbari . The taftoon bread didn't come to the table in some point we had to cancel. The koubideh came half burnt look like the grill wasn't even & very salty. The chicken kabob was very juicy. The Zaferan polo very delicious specially the tahdigh . The chicken with zereshk wasn't cooked well. We didn't get a chance ti try tea & dessert because the food came very late & as soon as we eat they asked to leave because the others were waiting for the table."
Berenjak,Bib,22-Jun-22,5,"Absolutely phenomenal food. My family and I have eaten at too many Persian restaurants to count and Berenjak's food is some of the best we've ever had. With two Michelin Stars, this is not surprising, but what is surprising is how reasonably priced everything is. You cannot go wrong eating here."
Berenjak,Bib,25-May-22,5,"Food was marvellous. Service was stellar and staff were polite and delightful. All setting the perfect ambiance for a lovely night with one other person you might fancy taking out, or even a group of friends! 10/10 will return."
Berenjak,Bib,20-Apr-22,5,"LITERALLY AMAZING! I found this restaurant from Dua Lipa's top 5 London restaurants on Eater.... and if Dua Lipa loves it...that means I had to try it for myself to. I swearrrr the hummus was probably one of the best hummuses I have ever eaten. The atmosphere of the restaurant is fantastic-- lively but also quiet enough to have a good conversation. If you go here, you have to try the baklava ice cream dessert; so freaking mouthwatering, everyone was absolutely stunned by it. Everything here was amazeballs"
Berenjak,Bib,26-Mar-22,5,"Um...what? How can a kebab be this good? How can a kebab menu be this inspired? Why hasn't this place been in my life before this? The search is over. I have found the best kebab ever. This is it. Get on a flight. Go to soho and visit berenjak. Casual friendly place. Staff is super kind and helpful. Come with a group and order everything. Kebabs and bread cooked in an amazing oven on premise. If you have a group go with the feast menu, but if it's just you and a friend do not forget to order a jigar. The jigar is the star. Sweetbreads and liver perfectly grilled and filled with flavor! Amazing. Also, an indication of the class of this place. They gave us free sides because they felt our food took too long. We were fine but gladly accepted. You can not beat this place!"
Berenjak,Bib,24-Feb-22,5,Astonishingly good hummus and lamb skewers. Small place but a warm atmosphere full of cooking and energy.
Hoppers,Bib,26-Jul-24,4,"Food was delicious! We made a reservation ahead of time and were able to get seated quickly. The inside is pretty small, but the tables don't start to get completely filled until after 7pm. We ordered the dosa, lamb kari (curry), coconut chutney, pol sambol, bone marrow varuval + roti, and the hot butter squid. For drinks, we got the guava lassi. Star of the show was definitely the bone marrow which melts in your mouth and goes perfectly with the flakey, soft roti. Guava lassi was absolutely perfect as well to wash everything down. The dosa and lamb were great, the lamb was very flavorful with a bit of a kick (I do wish I had maybe gotten a hopper instead to have more substance to mop up the sauce.) The hot butter squid reminded me a bit of calamari. Overall, a delicious meal in a prime location within SoHo."
Hoppers,Bib,27-Apr-24,4,"Hoppers- London, UK
4/26/2024
What I Had:
*Passionfruit & Elderflower Soda
*Lamb Kothu Roti
*Dosa
*Prawn Kari"
Hoppers,Bib,11-Feb-24,5,"Hoppers has amazing food and a menu with a lot of variety. I ordered a guava lassi, masala dosa with coconut chutney, and a drumstick sambhar on the side. It was all fantastic - the potato filling in the dosa was delicious, and the sweetness of the coconut chutney was the perfect classic complement (if they sold jars of the chutney separately to take home I'd definitely buy it)! I ordered the sambhar as a last-minute addition and was glad I did, because the spiciness of the stew rounded out the meal nicely.

Hoppers is just far enough off the Strand to not get overly crowded during the pre-show dinner rush, but it's still just a 10-15 minute walk away from most theaters. Lovely spot that I'll definitely return to!"
Hoppers,Bib,2-Feb-24,1,"Unpleasant Experience

I recently dined at this restaurant and unfortunately had a very disappointing experience. The staff exhibited behavior that made us uncomfortable and seemed discriminatory - refused to give us a proper back resting chair because we did not make reservation instead walked in. Though the restaurant had lot of empty tables and chair they just refused to provide one! The service was subpar, and we felt unwelcome. I hope the management addresses these issues to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment for all customers. Wouldn't recommend this place!"
Hoppers,Bib,4-Jan-24,4,"Exploring Soho and stumbled upon this gem - hands down one of my top meals in London. The black pork curry with rice and dosa was an absolute delight. Drinks were also pretty good. It was my first time trying South Indian food, and the speedy and attentive service made it even better. Perfect for solo diners too, they've got a table overlooking the outside for people dining solo."
Hoppers,Bib,10-Nov-23,4,"Vegan-friendly Sri Lankan place with a bunch of different offerings. They used to have a veggie mushroom kothu (£12) listed on the menu, but not any more apparently; regardless; they were still able to make it for me luckily, and it is default vegan.

The food came out in under 10 minutes. Reasonable portion, with a nice chewy texture from the roti, all sorts of mushrooms (including oyster mushrooms, which was nice), and other shredded veggies. Very solid, but not quite at the elite level of vegan kothus I've had. 4/5

They add a £1 optional charity charge to the bill by default, and another 10% for service -- you can wave these if you tell them, but that's still shitty to automatically add both. Not appreciated.

All in all, mediocre service and good vegan-friendly Sri Lankan food."
Hoppers,Bib,6-Nov-23,4,"If you enjoy Indian food, then you will enjoy this, I found it about 6 degrees separated from mainstream Indian . Flavors were different , interesting and tasty . Roti was good"
Hoppers,Bib,3-Oct-23,5,"Phenomenal food. Authentic, with a balance of the right spicy level.
Highly recommend the beef chilly fry."
Hoppers,Bib,31-Aug-23,5,The food was delicious with just the right amount of heat. It came really fast. The best meals were the chicken bites and the goat roti. The eggplant Kari turned out way better than the lamb Kari.
Hoppers,Bib,16-Jul-23,4,"Food was good, environment was nice and the service was friendly. We bought different plates and shared and enjoyed everything. This place was in a thriving part of Soho. There are a few other locations in London.


[unhappy a 12.5% tip was added AND a 1 pound donation (Donation Not explained on the bill but was on a card provided, and seems for a good cause, but I always like to research organizations before donating to assure they are fiscally responsible.). Forced tipping doesn't even happen in the US except for large groups, the tip capital of the world. Note that All the restaurants in London have been doing this and when you leave the city tips are not added or expected except token or for superb service.]"
Hoppers,Bib,22-Jun-23,5,"Excellent South Indian / Sri Lankan food set in picturesque Morlybourne Street. Who doesn't love a coconutty hopper with a coconut milk based chicken or fish curry? The food here is fresh flavorful and authentic. Interior decor is well done and in line with the London restaurant scene. Outdoor seating is pleasant on a summer afternoon - Hoppers and people watching go well together. Drinks are delicious as well I enjoyed the pineapple lassi. Pricing is on the higher side three adults and two children ate well for 100GBP. Service is prompt and friendly, the food comes out pretty quickly. Truly worth the hype highly recommended."
Hoppers,Bib,22-May-23,5,One of the best south Indian / Sri Lankan restaurants in all of London. The dosa was crispy and on point and went perfectly with some shrimp Kari. The uthappam was also top notch. We really had no complaints at all. I'd probably skip the mutton rolls as there are many other great options on the menu. We'll be back here to try more soon!
Hoppers,Bib,25-Mar-23,5,"I had the Lamb Kathu Roti, and it hit the spot! This place is busy, and rightfully so! Make a reservation if possible, and do not miss this as a stop when you are in SoHo! This place is one of my favorite restaurants that I have been to in London and is well worth your stop!

Order a Guava Lassi as well while you are here - it is an amazing twist on the traditional Lassi!"
Hoppers,Bib,31-Dec-22,3,"This place should be 5 stars because the food is quite good. The problem is that their portions are ridiculously small and expensive for what you get. I have lived in Sri Lanka for many years and know what is normally expected. Curries should be served with rice; however, here you pay quite a bit extra for a little bit of basmati rice. Hoppers and string hoppers are usually inexpensive items and there should be copious amounts to sop up the sauces. Here you pay a super inflated supplement for very small portions of these things. The condiments are served in thimble sized containers and should be free; here you will pay quite a bit for these extras. Even the main courses ie: curries are served in small containers that would at most be enough for one mildly hungry person. And yet, the food is really quite good! If they served larger sizes, were more generous with their supplements and less rapacious it would be a terrific place."
Hoppers,Bib,10-Nov-22,5,"This was one of the best meals I had in London (if not the best). I came on a weekday evening around 7. We didn't have a reservation and were told the wait would be about an hour to an hour half for a party of 4. We waited at a cafe nearby until they texted us.

Service here was very good and everything comes out very quickly which is nice.

WE ORDERED:
fish kari - pretty good! You should definitely order this if you love fish 4/5
black pork kari - amazing amazing option. Robust flavors and unforgettable taste 5/5
butter squid - highly recommend 5/5
dosa - very fun and interesting way to eat curry. Everyone should definitely try it! 5/5
fish rice - flavorful and delicious 4/5

Everything was amazing. There is a restroom. They also serve alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks and there is bar seating as well.
"
Hoppers,Bib,2-Oct-22,5,"My favorite food in London is at Hoppers, which I first discovered 5 years ago on my honeymoon and have been coming back to every time I'm in London. Their curries (or ""karis"") are just so flavorful and the meat is cooked so perfectly -- plus there are fun ""hoppers"" and ""dosa"" dishes (which are a gluten-free, lighter, crepe-like kind of bread vs. naan/roti -- although they have that too). I absolutely love Indian food, but Sri Lankan food is even better. I just think the combination of spices is smoother (less ""Christmas"" spice), and there's more use of coconut milk vs. dairy/yogurts (which adds another depth of flavor) -- and the spice levels can be customized to be just as spicy as your favorite Indian curry.

Must-try: ""masala dosa"" (a light crepe filled with mashed potatoes and spices) and a ""kari"" (my favorite is when they have the lamb shank kari, but I also love the chicken).

This spot in SoHo is the first of their 3 locations I think, and it definitely feels homey and cozy inside (which also means this is their smallest location and gets a little cramped). Reservations in advance are a must, since there aren't that many tables."
Hoppers,Bib,5-Jul-22,3,"Bone marrow Varuval + Roti 6.21/10- this was good but honestly way too creamy for me and I've come to the conclusion I'm not to keen on bone marrow as I don't really like the texture/consistency. It was very rich in flavor, however I got tired after the first few bites. I was hoping the roti (pictured on slide 5) was more like the consistency and taste of a paratha however it was a bit bland in my opinion. (One of their most popular dishes)

Chili Cheese Dosa 7.32/10- this was delicious. Normally not a chili cheese person however the combination was perfect and the breading felt like a thicker, more rich crepe. Incredibly filling though- could only eat a few bites

Prawn and green mango Kari 6.45/10- good but not really what I was expecting. Tasted incredibly coconut-y and honestly way to creamy for my liking especially in combination to be served with the chili cheese dosa. (Apparently one of their most popular menu items but I'd suggest getting the chicken/lamb kari)

Mutton Rolls with Lankan Ketchup 7.68/10- this was really good the breading reminded me of a mixture between churro and mozzarella sticks (not nearly anywhere as sweet as churros outer layer) the lamb melts in your mouth with a mix of creamy cheese. So filling but worth. (Also one of their most popular dishes)

Egg Hopper. 4.87/10- this reminded me of a more bland version of Ethiopian bread but with a coconut flavor to it. The egg yolk in the middle made it taste really good with the curry however this wasn't really my vibe. (Also really popular)

This was a cool experience. This is an award winning restaurant that serves Sri Lankan and South Indian dishes. It was a great experience, however incredibly filling and creamy. Their dishes definitely had lots of flavor to them and it is quite popular."
Hoppers,Bib,2-Jun-22,4,"Hoppers is a fantastic Sri Lankan restaurant with a couple locations around London (there's also one in south Marylebone and one in King's Cross). This one is the original and has all the same great food -- albeit I'm not as much a fan of the ambiance or layout here (it's a bit cramped and more run-down -- hence the 4 stars).

In terms of menu, you can't go wrong with the Taste of Hoppers -- though beware it's a ton of food! The mutton rolls and the hot butter squid are especially good, and the kottu roti is always a winner. Obviously the food is very flavorful and spicy, so think twice if you have a British palate!

Overall one of the gems of London's food scene."
Hoppers,Bib,27-Feb-22,4,"We came for lunch and ordered the chicken bites, two karis (aubergine and chicken), egg hopper, and masala dosa. The chicken bites were amazing, very juicy and tender, and perfectly marinated. The karis were good, but would have preferred more aubergine in the vegetarian one. The masala dosa was very good - probably our favorite, and perfect for sharing. The egg hopper looked aesthetic, but a rather bland egg white taste. Personally I preferred the coconut chutney to the karis, but good meal overall!"
The Barbary,Bib,11-Jul-24,5,"Dinner in June: fantastic experience. Staff was super, solid atmosphere, our waiter was terrific with wine and food recommendations (sorry don't have her name!). Dips with naan plus grilled lamb and octopus were soooo delicious. A really really great meal."
The Barbary,Bib,26-Jun-24,5,This spot is a stunner! Wow! The food is incredible! Secure a reservation for sure. We saddled up at the bar seating with direct views of the bustling kitchen. We asked our server to completely take the wheel on food decisions and she gave us a perfect star showing of the restaurants treats. Everything was booming with flavor. I highly recommend the pork neck. It's legendary. You won't be disappointed! Absolutely incredible restaurant making a mark!
The Barbary,Bib,7-Jun-24,5,"We are regular patrons of The Palomar so we wanted to try one of their other restaurants and Barbary didn't disappoint. Excellent food, cocktails/wine and ambiance. Love all the small plates and dips."
The Barbary,Bib,12-May-24,5,Absolutely spectacular cuisine ! Quaint and small which makes it an experience of its own .
The Barbary,Bib,5-May-24,5,"Fun atmosphere, incredible food and flavors, impeccable service! North African / Mediterranean influenced food delivered to perfection! Must-try!
I found Barbary on the Michelin app as a recommended Bib Gourmand, and it fits! I loved EVERYTHING!
This is the perfect stop pre-theatre / before a musical or theater performance. I came between Harry Potter showings of the cursed child and could not be happier -- fun atmosphere, singing and juggling to the music, delicious food, well balanced drinks, friendly staff. I totally was satiated while I sat and ate despite no reservations. This is a small round restaurant where the chefs and bartender are in the center stage to show you their magic. Highly recommend this unbelievably fantastic restaurant.

I loved the cauliflower Jaffa Style and Pata Negra (star of my meal - tender with charred crunchy edges and sweet savory garlic sauce). The Naan was excellent and fried violet artichoke were served on a bed of delicious dip."
The Barbary,Bib,26-Feb-24,5,"This was definitely our favorite restaurant during our latest London trip! Couldn't recommend enough

I had a few friends rave about this place, so I was on top of making a reservation as soon as it came out. The restaurant is fairly small, pretty much with only bar seating around the kitchen, so make your reservations early.
I love the open kitchen concept, where everyone can get a view of the kitchen since you're in a very large semicircle.
We came with a veteran Barbary friend who knew exactly what to order.
They fire grill everything to PERFECTION! Highly recommend getting the jerusalem bagel with a few mezzes to dip

I don't think you can go wrong with any of the dishes, but our favorites were probably the cauliflower, chicken, and octopus. But just get everything!"
The Barbary,Bib,23-Feb-24,5,"Our favorite meal in London was situated in the iconic Neal's Yard in Covent Garden. The dishes are inspired from the Barbary Coast, identified by 16th century Europeans as the area settled by the Berbers in the Atlas Mountains.

The menu focuses on the culture + heritage of countries from the Atlantic Coast through to the Mediterranean Sea leading to the Middle East.

Fire is at the center of everything they do.

*| what we ordered

Spinach Borani

Hashcake - pistachio tart"
The Barbary,Bib,13-Nov-23,5,"Amazing Mediterranean find in London! Tiny little spot with only bar tables, but wow!!!! Great, fun staff and we were lucky to get a spot without a booking due to a no-show. Definitely make a booking. Best house made lebne (which we watched them making), and hummus and the naan and their ""bagel"" were ridiculous. Also enjoyed the halloumi and the fattoush salad. We barely had room for the lamb which was moist and full of flavor. The open kitchen is fun and interactive. Must try for sure!!!!"
The Barbary,Bib,12-Nov-23,5,"The Barbary is in located Covent Garden and the food is absolutely delicious. It serves flavorful and fresh tapas right in front of your eyes with the open kitchen concept.

The vibe is casual. There is limited seating so make a reservation!

The menu is divided into land, sea, earth, and heaven (dessert). I tried the prawns, mushroom, naan (two servings), pork, and 3 dips. Almost every dish (I kid you not) gave me a wow factor. My only gripe is the pork was a tad too salty at times. (I didn't choose this dish).

I would totally recommend this restaurant to anyone. It served us well the first night. Loved watching my food being made. Excellent experience."
The Barbary,Bib,10-Nov-23,5,"Ok, I have this habit of closing my eyes when I want to focus all my attention to a taste that that is spectacular to my taste buds. The pork dish is such a dish that all my senses focused on the taste. Wow!
Such a cool place to have a seat around the kitchen bar and see how all the food is made. The cooking is really basic like cooking around a group of friends. The servers are terrific too. We just traveled through Egypt, Portugal, Jordan, Kenya and Tanzania and they seem to capture the food tastes of all these regions.Amazing. Run don't walk to this amazing restaurant."
The Barbary,Bib,6-Nov-23,5,"Had a Unique and intimate dining experience at the Barbary. It's a limited seating, Tapas kind small plates restaurant. Recommend making a reservation before hand. Great services from the staff. Food was delicious."
The Barbary,Bib,20-Oct-23,4,"Great food, great service. Interesting food and presented beautifully!Cramped and very loud-not intended for a romantic dinner. We would recommend."
The Barbary,Bib,27-Sep-23,5,"Don't miss going here . Best dinner I had in London's Covent Gardens district .
If you know of Ottolenghi it's like going to his personal restaurant .
The food the drinks and service are outrageously fantastic . We are at the Barbary counter service and the show of the kitchen dance was a major plus.
Don't miss going here ."
The Barbary,Bib,27-Sep-23,4,"Great dinner spot in a cool area. Loved the whole bar setup and vibe here - everything we tried was great. The highlight was the spice chicken, which was super moist and tender. Would definitely make a return visit when I'm in London again."
The Barbary,Bib,30-Jul-23,5,"Just got back from eating here and it was amazing! We stopped by to see if they had any walk in availability, expecting to not get in but, luck have it, a reservation didn't show up and we were seated almost immediately. The staff walked us through the whole menu and identified their favorites and we went with most of the recommendations. We started with the Jerusalem bagel with the aubergine dip. The bread was so soft and chewy with an amazing crust of sesame and zatar, it paired perfectly with the spreadable eggplant that was spiced so well. Our mains were the lamb kebab, oyster mushrooms, and cauliflower. The lamb was tender and grilled just right with the simplest salt and sauce that really let the protein shine through. The mushrooms had a very understated flavor but had the right texture and became so good with the mixture of char, lemon juice and tahini that it sat in. The star though was the cauliflower. The seasoning and sauce were so well balanced and the lightly fried texture could not have been better. We finished with the pecan baklava. I prefer pecans to pistachio and this was delicious with a nice crunch from the philo. It could have been warmed up just slightly but still tasty.

I can't finish the review without talking about the staff. Everyone was so nice and accommodating. I didn't get anyone's name but the staff working the night of July 30th showed how a restaurant should be run.

Def a must try when you're in Soho!"
The Barbary,Bib,27-Jun-23,5,"Phenomenal restaurant in Neal's yard. The concept is cool, you sit on the bar and the chefs cook in front of you. Make sure to have a reservation and I recommend only going with one other person since it's bar seating

I tried the labneh, naan, octopus, lamb, cauliflower and pistachio hash cake. Everything was out of this world, especially the dessert.

Service was great and the vibe was awesome. Would recommend this iconic restaurant to anybody in London"
The Barbary,Bib,26-Jun-23,5,"Our favorite dinner in London on this visit. Wonderful, interesting food in an energetic atmosphere. Attentive, positive service. A piece of advice...it is loud and the way the seating works, I suggest this is a place for couples and not groups, not even groups as small as four, if you want to talk...it's loud and hard for more than a couple to talk. But for a couple...especially a hip couple dressed to kill for a night on the town...The Barbary will be magical!"
The Barbary,Bib,22-Jun-23,5,"Great restaurant with amazing food, and great service. Place is a bit small, with seating just around the bar/grill area so make sure to have a reservation .

Between the two of us we did the labne, cauliflower, octopus, and lamb - which was the perfect amount of food. Cauliflower and lamb were my favorites. We also did the pistachio cake for dessert, which hands down was one of the best dessert I've ever had.

"
The Barbary,Bib,22-Jun-23,5,Intimate one to one friendly service defines this outstanding chef run kitchen. I've never been to the south of Spain or not in Africa but now I'm motivated by a taste of the food I had at Barbary. This restaurant is small and tightly packed but that makes for better engagement with their charismatic and knowledgeable staff. Sam did a great job of explaining the food and helped us choose just the right wine to go with it. The menu is simple and is laid out like a tasting menu - it's good to try one from each section at least. The breads and dips are delectable luckily the portion size is small so there's no fear of filling up too early on. I had fish for main course and it was just fantastic. Thinly sliced and perfectly cooked. I was already mighty impressed but I was blown away by the dessert. Who knew the simple and humble baklava could taste so good? Loved every moment of my time here I'm definitely coming back and I'm recommending that everyone try it. Book in advance because very rightly this place gets full.
The Barbary,Bib,4-Jun-23,5,Best meal and experience while visiting London. So many pieces have to come together to create a magical night. We loved every bit and every moment at the Barbary.
The Barbary,Bib,28-Apr-23,5,"Had an excellent dinner at The Barbary next door which is connected to the Barbary! Vy and Sam were incredible as well. The vibe, the food, the staff was just pure ""chefs kiss."""
The Barbary,Bib,10-Mar-23,4,"I was lucky to get a seat without a wait on a Friday night. Unfortunately it wasn't at the main bar where you can watch the chefs cook. It's a tiny place, with about 20 seats.

I got the naan, spinach borani dip, cauliflower, and pata negra. The naan was fluffy and well cooked but had way too much salt on it, which kind of ruined everything. The dip was ok. The cauliflower had a slight kick to it and was served with some sort of hummus which was nice. If I could do it again I'd ask for no salt on the naan and skip the dip.

The pata negra was definitely the star. Nicely cooked to a medium rare, well seasoned, and the sauce that comes with it helps balance out the fatty-ness. I only wish there was more sauce!

Overall, a fun intimate place in a cute little corner of Neal's Yard with good food. I'd go again to try more dishes."
The Barbary,Bib,15-Feb-23,5,"Freaking amazing, This was our last day in London and was looking for a great restaurant, this one had unbelievably high ratings in google and yelp, so i though, hey let give it a try. I am so glad i did, it took us a bit to find the place as it is a tiny place located down a equally tiny side street, once we got in the waitress was incredibly friendly and even though we did not have a reservation, she managed to find a place to seat us, We had the cauliflower jafa style - mouthwatering with just a tickle of spice, the naan - cooked to perfection - we ended up ordering 2 of them, the Jerusalem bagel - Lie a pretzel with alot of toasted seeds and severed with a cream sauce, the morrocan cigars - this is a monkfish dish, very tasty , the lamb armonim, the chicken shawarma & the pata negra - holy mother!!, the pata negra was over the top, it was one of the most unique dishes i have ever had, I am salivating remembering it now, a must have. then to finish off this amazing meal we had the hashcake, which of course was incredible. This is a must visit restaurant in London if you are craving Mediterranean food, or even if you have never had it before, this will be a great introduction to it."
The Barbary,Bib,13-Jan-23,5,"Whoa!

I was in town for some work and heard this place had great food. I decided to take a 2 mile walk across london so was starving when I arrived. I was just a party of one so was hoping i could snag a seat at the bar since it was a fairly small restaurant. As you walk in you see the central cooking area and bar area and everyone sat around the bar or along the walls. I waited about 30 minutes and was able to snag a seat on the wall. Not the greatest view, but i had no reservations. The waiter came up and asked me how hungry was I. I said i am ready to eat and told him that i trust him to deliver me a great meal.

The onslaught of food started and the food was just outstanding end to end. So highly executed. The standouts for me were the Cauliflower, Lamb and Pork dish. As you can see from my pictures i got a little of everything and Everything was delicious. Highly recommended."
The Barbary,Bib,7-Jan-23,5,"The Barbary is a fantastical restaurant with all seats centered around the open kitchen. The food was amazing. Every thing is made to share, and small plates means you can order tons of different things to try. I went with two others and we decided not to ask any questions or google any of the dish names. We went in blind and ordered about 8-9 plates, including dessert and wine. Highly recommend. One of the best restaurants I've been to in recent memory."
The Barbary,Bib,4-Jan-23,5,"What a great restaurant with North African inspired food. Great vibe and service. Place gets rocking as they have 2-3 seatings a night.

All the appetizers, dips with the naan and bagel were amazing. Lamb grilled bites were fantastic. Chicken shawarma was super tender and the pata negra was fantastic in the sauce. Finished with knefeh dessert."
Bao,Bib,10-Jun-24,3,"This restaurant would have been a 4 for the food, especially the the fried chicken bao but the service and ambiance were pretty awful. We had wrong dishes brought to us, we were hassled to leave multiple times even though all our dishes hadn't been brought to us.

Having no dedicated server and a totally packed restaurant, it was a cramped and hectic experience. However, the food was really great, so here we are at 3 stars. Maybe takeaway would be advised!"
Bao,Bib,31-May-24,4,"Definitely a small place! Quick service, great food, and left with fully belly. Great place to stop when in SoHo. Beware you will be required to wait outside during busy hours."
Bao,Bib,27-May-24,5,"An absolute pleasure.

Small, intimate, and simple yet flavorful options. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and attentiveness of the staff and instantly wished we had a place like this in the states.

A new favorite, everything was great and I highly recommend it.

I had the classic bao, beef bao, chips and mushrooms. Will be back."
Bao,Bib,25-Mar-24,5,We stopped on our walk by and it did not disappoint. Great service and the confit & fried chicken boa buns were off the charts good. Great time.
Bao,Bib,31-Dec-23,5,"Buns are one of my favorite foods in the world so expectations were high. I was still blown away!

There's often a line outside and the interior is small so it can feel a little hectic, but it's a really beautiful space that also feels trendy.

We came in a party of two on a weeknight and they were able to squeeze us immediately, with that caveat that we had to leave within an hour for another party's reservation.

We ordered 3 buns to share between the two of us and we immediately ordered more.
The confit pork was extravagant. Soft and absolutely melt in your mouth. It's like they took all the best qualities of a traditional pork belly bun and put it together.

The party next to us was halal and they had a little trouble ordering because all the fried items are fried in the same oil."
Bao,Bib,3-Dec-23,5,"I cannot recommend Bao highly enough. The food was amazing, the staff was friendly and provided recommendations, and I left feeling satisfied and that I'd gotten my money's worth. We tried a lot more than what is pictured here, but we couldn't stop eating long enough to take the pictures.


"
Bao,Bib,27-Nov-23,5,"This is a very small, intimate place in the SoHo district. Walking in the staff was extremely friendly and we were immediately seated. Our waiter reviewed the menu with us and gave us great suggestions.
I filled out the little order form and handed it to our waiter. In total, we ordered the scallop appetizer along with the confit pork, fried chicken and braised beef bao buns with a side of sweet potato chips that came with an interesting plum pickle ketchup. As a tea lover, I couldn't resist ordering the 10-year aged Oolong tea as I've never had an aged tea.
The order came out in less than 10 minutes and so we dug in. The scallop appetizer was really tasty with a nice char on the outside.
Each of the bao buns themselves were so soft and just melted in my mouth. The filings for each were super flavorful. The confit pork and braised beef were very tender and packed a flavor punch. The friend chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.
The sweet potato chips (fries) were nice and crispy, and the plum pickle ketchup provided was a nice change from a regular tomato ketchup.
As for the 10-year aged Oolong tea, it has an earthier taste than most Oolongs I've tasted. It was worth trying just for my own personal knowledge.
Overall, this is a great place to grab a quick, light bite while in the SoHo district but take note that the establishment is very small and not good for large groups."
Bao,Bib,23-Apr-23,5,"Amazing food! Everything here was excellent. I honestly bought the cookbook after going here. It's pricy, but the quality is amazing. Sometimes, it's hard to find good Taiwanese food, and this place met all the criteria. They even do the menu the Taiwanese way - you write down the quantity next to the menu item name.

I recommend getting reservations in advance. It is very tiny inside, so be prepared to be squished next to everyone."
Bao,Bib,26-Feb-23,4,"Bao is across from my office in London and I tried to find a time to go there the first few times I visited the office and was never able to fit it in. On my most recent trip, I was determined to try it and on the last day told my colleagues I would not be eating with them but going to Bao. I went inside to tell them I wanted to get take out and they told me to wait outside until someone came to take my order. Once that happened (about five minutes later), the bao took less than ten minutes. I had the pork and the fried chicken and probably could have had another. While both were very good, I didn't find it to be that much better than the Bao that I often have in New York City so it's probably not somewhere I had to go so far out of my way to try. That being said, I live in New York City. In London this may well be the Bao place to go to."
Bao,Bib,25-Feb-23,1,"Food was good but we had a big issue with one of the dessert buns.

We were seated at the bar and at the end of the meal we ordered a dessert bun. A few minutes later we saw the person sitting next to us get the dessert bun we ordered. We didn't say anything because maybe she ordered one as well. But sure enough the person waves down the waitress and says she didn't order the bun. We kept an eye on the bun (from the bar you can see the kitchen) and saw the chef hold the bun up to a heat lamp to reheat the bun and had the waitress give us the same bun!

When the waitress tried to give us the bun we told her we knew the bun went to the wrong person and we wanted a new one. We also told her it wasn't her fault but it's unacceptable and gross for the chef to do what he did."
Bao,Bib,9-Feb-23,5,"Bao WOW! Loved the Bao buns. Lively atmosphere, it will be packed, don't expect to stretch out and be cozy, expect great food."
Bao,Bib,17-Dec-22,5,"A fun restaurant with great vibes and even better food. There is a great lunch special that allows you to try bao and rice bowl! All the bao that I tried were delicious, with my favorite being the pork belly. Appetizers were amazing as well, especially the beef. The drinks were also very delicious - would recommend!"
Bao,Bib,1-Dec-22,5,"Absolutely incredible. The highlights were actually the rice bowl dishes! SO flavorful and yummy (though quite small for sharing!)

My friend and I ended up ordering from the set menu (15 pounds?) as well as the regular menu, and got the confit pork + lamb shoulder baos, the fried chicken, the beef soup with braised daikon, the scallop, the guinea fowl rice (+ the specialty rice bowl they had that was lamb IIRC). Also had the yakult and peanut milk drinks. Everything was absolutely amazing. The soup was perfect for a cold day in London. The rice was so good, and my friend and I marveled at how the rice itself managed to taste so good (it's hard to find places that make rice plates taste homemade in Europe, we agreed).

The drinks were also very unique. Never had a pineapple drink with yakult foam before ... but here we are!

We came as walk-ins a little around 5:30-6pm and were able to be seated right away but the restaurant was definitely busy the rest of the time we were there, so I recommend reserving in advance or going earlier when they open.

(We also got the cute tote bags and even the little neighborhood map ... too iconic to pass up!)"
Bao,Bib,24-Nov-22,4,"I ordered the classic, fried chicken, and confit pork bao. I was lucky enough that there was no wait and I had my food within about 10 minutes. Having eaten a late lunch, this was the perfect amount of food although you'd likely need something with it if you go in hungry to truly fill you up.

The pork was tender and had just the right amount of fat. The fried chicken had a perfect crunch and the classic failed to disappoint. My only complaint was that I wolfed them down too quickly :). Otherwise, a great spot for sure.

The restaurant was incredibly small and seating was more ""bar style"" where you aren't able to face anyone. Makes it a great spot for solo eaters or friends, but definitely not anyone on a date. I'd highly recommend making reservations as I've heard plenty of stories of people waiting 50+ minutes for a table.

Highly recommend though. Everything was made deliciously and had great flavor."
Bao,Bib,22-Sep-22,5,"I've been here on several occasions. The food is the best I've ever had. It's authentic from what I can tell, and ingredients are fresh. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the wine selection is awesome."
Bao,Bib,19-Aug-22,4,"BAO is a cute, tiny lunch spot, so make sure to make a reservation or get there early! Unfortunately, the confit bao was out of stock when my family was there, so I ordered the classic and the daikon baos. The classic came with braised pork, peanut powder, coriander, and fermented greens; the peanut powder added a nice nuttiness and the buns were so fluffy. The daikon bao came with crumbled daikon, daikon pickle, hot sauce, and coriander; the pickled daikon worked so nicely against the crispy piece of daikon that almost melted in your mouth once bitten into. I also got a yakult float drink, which was unique and delicious.

The one issue my family had with BAO was that the service was incredibly slow. While we understand it is a small place that is packed and busy, it took quite awhile for the food to come out. My dad ordered the pre-fixed menu, but his rice bowl took so long to come out that he eventually asked them not to bother making it so that we could leave and get on our way. Luckily, the service was very accommodating. They handled the situation remarkably well, which was definitely of note and something we were grateful for. Overall, I would come back again for a (hopefully) quick bite with friends or a takeout meal!"
Bao,Bib,7-Jul-22,5,"First of all, let me start by saying I have been religiously following Bao on Instagram for years even before I've ever been to London. When I finally got to visit post-Covid in January, I went to their SoHo location and got to try their fried chicken and confit baos which I both loved! These are textbook amazing baos that are of quality and surprisingly filling for what it is. The bun of the fried chicken one is also somewhat made with sesame which I liked. I got one of their alcoholic spritz which complemented my order well.

I went back here for the second time last week, same location though I should've went to the Covent Garden (?) branch not too far from SoHo since they only serve the pork rice dish I was intending for! I wish they made that clear on their social media page for future reference since they introduce limited menus once in a while that turns out, will only be available at specific locations.

I got seated as soon as they opened at 12nn (pretty late for my opinion,) and the place easily got packed right away. They don't really have a lot of rice bowl options in this location but only mostly small plates and the baos. I re-ordered the confit pork bao which is always a winner and got the Spicy Taiwanese fried chicken along with it. The chicken was absolutely juicy and flavorful! It wasn't too spicy at all, too. I judged it beforehand and didn't really expect how it will blow me away for how juicy it is. Aside from that, the real star of my meal was the house made peanut milk with vanilla which was so refreshing! Never tasted anything quite like it before. Even the thin-rimmed glass they serve it in was perfect for the whole drinking experience. I would definitely go back to Bao over and over whenever I'm in town and would never not get the peanut milk!

This is also a great restaurant for solo diners. I got to sit at the bar twice and loved the experience of being in front of the barista. They also have a ""long day menu"" which is a curated order for solo diners. I would've gotten it but I was skeptic to try the guinea fowl dish.

Also, vibe is a 5/5. Cute staff and cute people dining in!"
Bao,Bib,3-Jun-22,5,"The Bao's were so good! I got the original and the fried chicken. Perfect for take out. I should have gotten 3, they were so good but a bit small and I had a big appetite that day after lots of sightseeing. Seating is quite limited so it is not suited for groups. Services is fast and friendly!

The fried chicken was perfectly crispy and not heavy. The pork was flavourful and sweet.

Highly recommend to eat and walk around or take out and eat at the park."
Bao,Bib,27-Feb-22,5,"amazing bao ! everything was super delicious. my favorite bao was the confit pork because it was flavorful with super duper soft meat !

the table was super small, but service was excellent. prices were also fair.

without a reservation we only waited 30 minutes to be seated."
Bao,Bib,24-Jan-22,5,"GREAT for solo dining! Everything was delicious and unique. I got the confit bao and the Guinea fowl rice bowl, which both did not disappoint. The pork and guinea fowl were both so tender and juicy and all the textures of the dishes meshed together well. Additionally, get their chicken Kaarage too!"
Padella,Bib,22-Jul-24,5,"What a gem of a restaurant, best pasta I have had in years, great service and the owner is a sweetheart of a person, staff was delightful and the food was incredible! As a New Yorker, I would recommend this place to any foodie I know! MAKE a reservation, the place is packed all night and rightfully so!"
Padella,Bib,7-Jul-24,5,Wow wow wow. Can't recommend Padella highly enough. Each and every pasta dish we tried delivered its own unique brilliance.
Padella,Bib,29-Jun-24,5,"Best pasta I have ever had! Worth the wait, especially when food comes out quickly. Pici cacio & pepe, the beef shin ragu, even my daughter's plain pasta was like nothing we've ever tasted!"
Padella,Bib,21-Jun-24,2,"This showed up in a list of must places to try when in London. We walked over and gave it a try.

3/5 Cacio e Pepe - was good but I thought it tasted a bit off

2/5 - Tagliarini with crab - this tasted very weird. The pasta was too thin for our liking and wayyy too lemony

So many great reviews. Guess I'm just basic?
"
Padella,Bib,28-May-24,5,Great value for quality Italian food in London. This was one of my favorite meals on my trip to London. It's right by the borough market. You can add your name to the queue and they'll text you when your table is ready (so you don't have to wait around). We had the pappardelle and cacio e pepe. The pastas were amazing! They make it out in the front so you know they're fresh. The seats aren't the most comfortable but the place always gets pretty busy. The service was pretty good here. I'll definitely come back and try some other dishes because the meal was excellent.
Padella,Bib,23-May-24,5,"This Pasta Place in London is still some of the best Italian food that I've ever had. It rivals and maybe exceeds the taste and quality of food we had in Italy. It is no wonder this place is completely packed every time we visit, with a line waiting out front to dine. The food quality is outstanding, the prices are fair and the service is great. I only wish I could find Italian this good in California. Bravo!"
Padella,Bib,24-Apr-24,5,"We were in London for a weeek and was looking for a good pasta restaurant. All their pasta were homemade and taste AWESOME! Their menu is simple but every dish is done to perfection. We ordered 4 pasta dish plus asparagus. The asparagus was on the expensive side. But the pasta were flavorful. How can we not end the meal at an excellent restaurant without a tiramisu?! We ordered one and as expected, it was great.
It's busy so expect a queue (virtual)."
Padella,Bib,18-Mar-24,4,Don't let this spot pass you by! Coming here you wont be disappointed with the fresh pasta made and prepared in front of you. The Tagliarini was both fresh and creamy complimented with chili and leamon which was complimented with a nice red. Suggest to get on the waitlist ahead of time because the line is ridiculous and even the virtual waitlist gets full however... worth it.
Padella,Bib,27-Feb-24,5,"Simple great menu, high quality food and great service! A new favorite. We didn't have a reservation but they fit us in, which is what a place focused on delighting customers should do vs throwing shade at you!"
Padella,Bib,7-Jan-24,4,"Make sure you get the dojo app ahead of time so you can put yourself on the waitlist when you are close to the restaurant. For us the wait time was actually only about 1/3 of the quoted wait time, which was a pleasant surprise so make sure you are in the area.

As for the food, everything was generally decent, but the pappardelle in with beef ragu was exceptional. The bruschetta was a bit too rough and dry and a bit bitter for my taste and the cacio & Pepe was a bit greasy and too thick for my taste. I'd actually rate this place about 3.5 stars rounding up to 4. I've had better Italian food without this much of a wait, but the food overall was good and service and ambiance was solid."
Padella,Bib,15-Dec-23,5,"Incredible pasta! Every dish we tried is perfection. Service was just right and welcoming. Enjoyed their non-alcoholic options, can get loud at night but worth it for this food."
Padella,Bib,10-Dec-23,5,"Another frequent London recommendation that was totally worth the hype!! As a solo diner I only had to wait ~15 mins for a bar seat, and walked around Borough market as I waited.

What a cool vibe at the bar as you get to watch your food being made right in front of you!! Fresh pasta is always a win for me. I ordered the pesto and I kinda wish I had gotten a different sauce as this was good but a little boring after a few bites. But the pasta itself was fantastic, as was everything else I had. A little pricey but I'd pay again for that view of the kitchen!

Highly recommend stopping by before a show at the Globe if you can swing it!"
Padella,Bib,23-Oct-23,3,"Queued up here just before it opened so we were able to be seated at the window right away. After my visit to Italy, I realized that Pici is my favorite type of pasta but I struggle to find it in many restaurants in the US or UK. I was excited to see it on the menu here so I had to try it. The prices were quite steep and the portions quite small, but the food was tasty. I'm glad I was able to try it, but I would not come back for this price."
Padella,Bib,21-Oct-23,3,"I think I need to stop ordering cacio e pepe at restaurants outside of Italy because I always end up disappointed. It was recommended to me by the server so I tried it but...I don't know. It certainly had the right amount of pepper, which I was thrilled about but the cheese was just not cheesing the way it should have."
Padella,Bib,13-Oct-23,5,"The last time I was here was 2019 & this place still has great quality pasta. They always has a line so make sure to get on the queue before the restaurant opens via the QR code. Wait is usually 40 min or so.

Food is freshly made, service is great, & the ambiance is a cool 2 story spot next to borough market. The pici cacio e Pepe was a bit too aldente for me but nonetheless delicious. Will definitely be back!"
Padella,Bib,3-Oct-23,3,"I tried the famous pasta which was delicious, but i felt like the quantity was not it. Service was stellar and we were treated very well, and the ambiance is great as there are two floors with lots of space - feels like you are at a hidden spot!"
Padella,Bib,24-Sep-23,5,"Absolutely the best pasta I've ever had. We got the Pici cacio & Pepe and the Fettuccine with Cobble Lane Cured nduja, mascarpone & lemon . Fresh, great service, and in a great part of the city being closed to Borough Market."
Padella,Bib,19-Sep-23,5,"This was amazing all around.

Short of it, the pasta is outstanding because it's not drowning in sauce. The light olive oil and spices give it a bold flavor while allowing you to really enjoy the pasta they're making on-site. If you have room, the tiramisu is light and fluffy and probably the best I've ever had. The pasta is probably top 3-4 and I pasta very often.

Servers were passionate and funny, and you get in and out in record time. I wish I didn't need to fly 10 hours for pasta this good. Londoners are so lucky to have Padella."
Padella,Bib,15-Sep-23,5,Great food and service. Sat at chefs counter and chefs were very affable and pasta was amazing.
Padella,Bib,13-Sep-23,5,Hands down the best food I've had in all of Europe!! Passion and care goes into each dish and it shows. You will not be disappointed
Padella,Bib,19-Aug-23,3,"Casual Italian restaurant. We shared bread, a ragú pappardelle, and a tagliarini with a crab and lemon sauce. We sat in their lower level which had two gender neutral restrooms; one had a baby changing table and had a airplane bathroom feel to it."
Padella,Bib,12-Aug-23,3,"Pretty good Italian food. Definitely try the linguini. Luckily there was no line or a wait when we went. But be prepared, the portions are small, and you also have to pay for bread!!"
Padella,Bib,19-Jul-23,5,"Quality/Quantity -
Wow, what a GREAT find; probably one of our best meals in London!
Small simple menu, made fresh. Small and simple both for foods and drinks, see pictures of the menu.
Pappardelle - I am a spaghetti kind of person, but my recent go to pasta has been pappardelle. I have been getting this very frequently, especially when I know it is made in house.
Fettuccine with Cobble Lane Cured Nudja, Mascarpone & Lemon - Don't get me wrong, I really liked my dish, but I wish I had ordered this one. It had just the right amount of ""kick,"" a slight spice to it. The sauce was amazing.

Unfortunately, they only had one beer on tap, the Helles Lager. The good news was that it complimented my dish perfectly. Light and refreshing.

Atmosphere - Very small two floor local restaurant. Normally a long wait, but we were lucky enough to get the last two seats in the downstairs bar.
Indoor/outdoor dining.
Open 7 days a week, see their website or Yelp for specific hours. Both differ slightly.
Borough Market is also a very cool place to hang out.

Service - Okay, they are crazy busy, so don't expect personalized service. The good thing was that we were not in a rush.

Price - 35 pounds + tip; good price for what we got. Fine dining quality pasta in a fast casual atmosphere.

Owner Comment - Congrats on your success with your two locations, three restaurants. We will be sure to come back and visit on our next London trip."
Padella,Bib,8-Jul-23,5,"I happen to be in London on business, and found Padella while wandering around the Borough area of the city. I was traveling alone and looking for a meal at peak dinner time on a Friday. I was pleasantly surprised to get a seat within 10 min!

Simple food prepared with care and fresh, high quality ingredients, that's how I describe my meal. It was delicious!!

I had a rocket and mint salad with a light, bright dressing. You should get this healthy, refreshing salad.

For my main course I opted for the fettuccine with pistachio and pesto. It was terrific! The pasta was made fresh, with just the right Al Dente-ness, and the sauce was creamy, fresh and amazing.

It should also be noted that the server was enthusiastic, friendly and helpful.

Two thumbs way up!"
Padella,Bib,29-Jun-23,5,Best food I've literally ever had. So adorable and savored every bite. Please go you'll think about it forever and ever. My food with beef on top was amazing
Padella,Bib,1-Jun-23,4,"Very delicious place. Came from the states and was unsure what to expect. Food was fresh, drinks were delicious. Like many places it was small and compact, with very little air flow. That being said I would certainly go back."
Padella,Bib,14-May-23,5,"Though you have to wait in line, it really is worth it. Really good Italian just like my Sicilian grandmother used to make. This place is not fancy or pretentious in any way. It's a rather small, crowded place with great food at great prices. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. I try to eat here anytime I'm in London."
Padella,Bib,10-May-23,5,Best pasta I've had in awhile. Was so cool to see the kitchen in action sitting at the bar. Service was quick! Highly recommend. Probably not good for big parties though.
Padella,Bib,25-Apr-23,5,Pasta was delicious! Perfect place for me to carb up the night before the London marathon.
Padella,Bib,22-Apr-23,4,"I've researched places to eat near Borough Market that was delicious and affordable. This place was it. They had a QR code that you had to scan to put your name on the queue. The wait time was around 45 mins or so and we went on a late Monday morning. (Granted it was also Easter holidays too.)

I had a hard time figuring out what to order but with recommendations from the waiter I ordered a picI e cacio Pepe and my husband ordered their ravioli. Having had a good amount of wine the night before I opted for water whilst my husband ordered their cloudy lemonade. He said it was some of the best he's had and so he ordered some more.

For an appetizer we ordered the bruschetta and sourdough bread with olive oil. The bread itself was so divine and it soaked up the oils from the tomatoes and made it that more delicious. We both loved it and split the last alice of bread. As for the sourdough bread itself we used it to soak up the wonderful sauces from the pasta that we had ordered.

The ravioli was freshly cooked and the sauce was very light yet delicious. I've never had cacio e pepe but was delighted by the flavor and texture. The firmness of the pasta was a bit on the tougher side for me but not enough to turn me off completely. I would definitely order a side of the sauce if they had the option.

The space inside of Padilla was small and the outside dining area could easily seat 12 people. It was a relatively nice weather day and so sitting outside wasn't so bad.

The bill came to £58 for the two pasta, bread, appetizer and lemonades. We'd recommend going here if you can squeeze in a little bit of time."
Padella,Bib,12-Apr-23,5,"Wife and I agree - best pasta we have ever had.

Cacio e Pepe and pappardelle were both excellent. Get the sourdough bread too so you can dab up the sauce at the end to leave no trace behind

Service was great. Wait was very nice with the virtual queue. Food came out very fast and hot!

10/10."
Padella,Bib,12-Apr-23,4,"This popular pasta place has been on my to-eat for a while as I gave up queuing several times seeing the long queue outside the Borough Market branch. Thanks to my friend who arrived at 11:30, we managed to get a table at 11:45 on a Saturday! If you are arriving before 12:45, head straight to the restaurant and scan the QR code at the entrance. Otherwise, you can download the Dojo app and join the virtual queue in advance. Knowing it's our first visit, a staff members kindly introduced their pasta dishes in detail which was really helpful for a picky eater like me. (w/ 12.5% service charge)

Tagliarini with Dorset crab, chilli & lemon (£16)A lightly seasoned dish with fresh crab meat that whetted my appetite. It's not very spicy and I like the long-lasting taste of lemon zest. Nice but not as overwhelming as the ravioli.

Ravioli of Westcombe ricotta with Sardinian tomato sauce (£12.5)
Chewy ravioli stuffed with ricotta with a pleasant dairy flavour. The tomato sauce was so flavourful with a hint of basil. Simply amazing!

Salted caramel & chocolate tart (£6)
Don't skip dessert because this tart is Phenomenal! The chocolate layer is crispy outside and gooey inside. I hate desserts that are too sweet but this tart was just perfect as the thin layer of salted caramel along the crust balanced well with the bitterness of chocolate.

Tiramisu (£6.5)
Tiramisu is creamy and rich in chocolate flavour but I like the version with Marsala wine better."
Padella,Bib,11-Apr-23,5,"This is my second time visiting London and my second time eating at Padella.. and for good reason. The food is phenomenal. The pasta is fresh and the portions are perfect. The staff is friendly and it is clean. It is a very tight space but I promise it's worth it!
"
Padella,Bib,18-Mar-23,5,"My favorite meal in London, I would recommend it again and again!

Opens weekdays at 11:30am so I showed up around 11:20am and put our name on the list via QR code. Table was ready but I was browsing the market so got back around 11:45am-11:50am. Wow, the place was so packed already!

The ground/top floor seemed cool with bar seating where you can watch them make the pasta. We were sat downstairs at the bar where the bartenders are.

The bar stools are goddamn uncomfortable. Worst part of the experience.

We shared 2 dishes:
-PAPARDELLE WITH 8 HOURS BEEF RAGU. The pasta noodles were so perfect but I wasn't in love with the meat. It wasn't bad though.

- TAGLIARINI WITH CRAB (LOBSTER?) I forget which one it was. Gosh the pasta noodles were so perfect on this one too and I loved the crab and all the spices blended together. A+

Glad I got to try both as they were pretty different from each other, but both oh so good."
Padella,Bib,15-Mar-23,5,"Wow wow wow. This was incredible. Some of the best pasta I have had. We put our name into the queue and we're surprised to be sat within five minutes.

Staff could not have been friendlier and each staff member pleasantly interacted with us as they served our food.

The food was divine. Some of the best pasta dishes I have ever had. Try the 8-year old beef pasta- that was our group's highlight. So fresh and light. Incredible!!"
Padella,Bib,14-Mar-23,5,"Yum! I don't think Padella even needs my review-everyone seems to already know it's the best!
Visiting from America, we spent the afternoon exploring Borough Market and the surrounding area. Padella had been recommended, and we happened to stumble upon it as it is quite literally right next to the market. Anyways, as we did some online research, we realized we'd want to join the queue ASAP since they don't take reservations. We joined at 4:30 right when it opened up (via QR code outside the restaurant), and then continued to explore Southwark. Got a text a little after 5pm, and we headed back to be seated.

The restaurant is small and simple, but that's usually a good sign. We were pleasantly greeted by the host who seated us at the end of the bar and mentioned we would have 1.5hrs (understood, because this place is busy!) We enjoyed sourdough bread, a Negroni, white wine, Nduja pasta, and cacio e Pepe. It was all delicious, and the atmosphere was great. Within 15 minutes of us being there, there was a line outside and every seat was full! Padella is a must. The pasta is handmade right in front of you, and you can really taste the freshness. We concluded our meal with some tiramisu which was also perfect! The service was quick!
Our server was very sweet as was the rest of the staff. Not a single negative thing to say. Wish I could visit London more so I could come back to eat this pasta!"
Padella,Bib,5-Mar-23,5,"It's hard to do pasta much better than this! They serve all the classics plus some more unique seasonal recipes of their own. We tried the Cacio e Pepe and the Ravioli which were delicious but the Tagliarinj blew us away. We still talk about this pasta whenever we go anywhere else and can't wait to try it again! Be prepared to queue but it's so worth it!

"
Padella,Bib,20-Jan-23,5,"Literally Perfection. Amazing service and dynamic. So fire. A guy with glasses, red beanie, and earring amazing dude."
Padella,Bib,7-Jan-23,5,"Do yourself a favor and come here.

The hype is real, every time I'm on London I make sure to come by. They don't take 'reservations' but you can download an app or scan the QR code outside their building and get in the queue. I usually come in the afternoon since it's less crowded.

The food overall is always on point and I've never had an issue. The drinks compliment the food well (I had a negroni) and you can't beat their prices -- they have plates for around $8! It took a bit of time to decide what to have because everything looked so good, and the staff were very helpful and patient with me. All the food tasted fresh and flavorful and major points with the heavy hand on the parm cheese."
Padella,Bib,2-Jan-23,5,"Wow, must visit for hand made pasta in London. The cacio e pepe is to die for and better than most I've eaten in Rome, where the dish is most famous. The pappardelle was also good, although I prefer the cacio e pepe. The line can be quite long, so be prepared to wait. The portions are small, so for two people 3-4 pastas should be enough."
José,Bib,22-Jul-24,5,"Let me start by saying we came across this restaurant by accident.... It was busy on a Monday and the ambience was fun! We decided to try. We were greeted right away and wanted to get a table outside. Didn't have to wait long. Luis was amazing and we asked him to recommend his favorites.... We tried every one of them and all were delicious. Started with Jamon Iberico, mushroom croquettes, prawns in chili and garlic, olives stuffed with oranges!( amazing btw), Pluma iberico(outstanding)... drinks were Sherry to start, wine with dinner and finished with Carajillo's and dessert! We are in a food and drink coma now and walking the long way back to our hotel! loved loved loved this place!"
José,Bib,30-Oct-23,5,"What a gem. Stumbled into this VERY authentic Spanish Tapas restaurant in a charming little borough. We are Americans and had just left the Tower of London and Tower Bridge Tour and we're ready for a nice break. The restaurant was about a 5 minute walk from the Tower Bridge. We found it on Yelp. The wine was excellent. We had an Albariño and a Tempranillo that were outstanding. The food was as authentic as it gets. We had pan con tomate, jamón ibérico, clams in white wine and garlic the fried goat cheese and honey. And the almond cake. All were perfection. Highly recommend!"
José,Bib,29-Oct-23,5,"Bermondsey Street was a main thoroughfare for us. It may not have always been the most direct route but when you don't know where you're going, it's good to go where you know as you figure it out. I will say that the app - City Mapper - is worth installing on your phone. Oh, but when you're travelling out of the US, you don't want to pay the high roaming charges. Then I say, go to the ""airalo"" website and see if what they offer might meet your needs, and if it does, install it too. Most newer phones allow you to install electronic SIMs. If you follow the instructions very carefully, you can set your phone up to use this second line for local data access and that will allow City Mapper to run for you while you roam around. I know that I'm sounding like a commercial but that's how much I liked using the app. While I didn't always know which direction I was facing, by watching the app as I moved, I could see if I was heading toward or away from my target.

Okay, back to Jose. We walked by this place several times, both during the day and at night. They always had guests, especially at night when the crowd seemed to spill out of the restaurant to the outside tables and surrounding area. People looked happy as they indulged in their food and wine. We stopped once and read the menu. It's quite small and written on a chalkboard. It looks like every now and then, they erase something and write something else up. Having been to Barcelona, we weren't particularly impressed with the menu and didn't plan on dining there. Until I read the reviews. And looked at their website and learned about Jose Pizzaro, chef, owner of six restaurants in London and one in Abu Dhabi, author of six cookbooks, a regular on BBC cooking shows AND that the Tapas Bar Jose is mentioned as a Bib Gourmand in the Michelin Guide.

Service was wonderful. It was cool watching Chef prepare our food. The Pan con Tomate was so simple and yet so delicious. A slice of bread, toasted, rubbed with garlic, rubbed roughly with a ripe tomato, slightly salted and drizzled with olive oil. I could eat that every single day and LOSE WEIGHT.

The Bermondsey Bomba was like a giant Porto Bakery (forgive me Jose) Potato Ball with more meat in a spicy sauce placed on top of a bed of aioli with a dollop of seasoned tomato paste on top. I could eat these every single day and GAIN WEIGHT.

The Boquerones were heavenly. The Clams with Garlic and Parsley, devine. And the Patatas Bravas...come on man, they're just potatoes! Crispy on the outside, soft and warming on the inside. Once again, the aioli and seasoned tomato paste just brings it all together.

Service was warm and friendly. They were kind enough to let us order in rounds so we could gauge how much to order. Honestly, we had five dishes and were stuffed.

Pictures to follow."
José,Bib,16-Oct-23,5,Great food - excellent service - nice vibe - not too expensive. Highly recommend. Will seek out next time in the area.
José,Bib,29-Sep-23,5,"Outstanding food, wine and service. Started with the pan tomate and jamon iberico. Followed up with croquetas. And polished off with goat cheese covered in honey. The waiter was lovely. Highly recommend."
José,Bib,30-Aug-23,3,"I'm sorry I don't understand the hype.

We waited 15min in the rain to be seated only to be given a 1.5hour dinning time. Hey initially brought a drinks menu to us when we are waiting in the queue but they didn't come to take our order until we got our table so I don't see the point.

We ordered a wine and a beer. Wine tasted worse than most wine we have in other restaurants and the beer is with a thick foam and small glass..

The food is alright but with the service and portion, I didn't think we get our money's worth."
José,Bib,16-Aug-23,5,"We originally walked passed Jose not thinking we were going to get in due to how busy it was. We took a walk and walked up and lucky had a 15 min wait which having a bottle of wine helped the time go by.

The food was amazing. We bad a lovely service named Burha whom guided my wife and I through the menu and helped us figure out what amazing food to order.

I would say have trust in your server.
This place is amazing tapus food and and an amazing place to wine, dine and relax and enjoy the atmosphere.
Enjoy"
José,Bib,31-Jul-23,5,"Great food. Small tapas dishes.
Since I don't do alcohol, I can't say anything about wine.
Also. I don't eat meat. But I didn't have any trouble finding things I could eat. Plenty of veggie and seafood dishes available here.

There are not many other options on Bermondsey st. So, you might struggle a bit if you decide the queue at José is too much.

It can be a bit loud inside."
José,Bib,6-Apr-23,5,"My first time in London and I was with my LOVE mate and our new good mate. A great time was guaranteed already given the company but the food was terrific! We were there last week and I wanted to shout out from NYC: ""Go to Jose and bring your gay partner! "" That's really specific, but it was nice to be somewhere and not be stared at for being in love and having a great time :). Say hello to the Chef and try the tomato bread!"
José,Bib,6-Mar-23,5,"Excellent flavors, and fun ambiance. The seafood and uniqueness will get me to go out of my way for this."
José,Bib,5-Dec-22,4,"No reservations at Jose so be sure to get here early and on time, the restaurant is quite small, but turnover is fast! My favorite was the con tomato - the tomato bread which is toasted, scraped with garlic, and then topped with tomato.

They also have great beers on tap, and a extensive selection of cocktails and wine. Great place for a date with girlfriends or s.o."
José,Bib,6-May-22,5,"I took a bit of a change with a hangry five year-old and an (almost) hangry wife in asking them to walk from the Tower of London to this location. After the dishes came out, there were no more complaints. Jamon Iberico that gets caught just slightly in your throat, like it should, that paired perfectly with the cheese plate. The patatas bravos almost convinced me I was in Barcelona and, I daresay, the croquetas were the best I ever had. I could get Estrella Damm on tap but the true star was the Negroni Española which featured scotch and PX (Pedro Ximenez sherry in place of the Campari). We could have sat and sipped those all day, but that is impossible with a child in tow. This is a lovely place, I hope you walk a bit extra and enjoy it as I did."
José,Bib,29-Apr-22,5,"Packed on Friday for lunch but luckily we got two spot by the bar. Amazing food and wine. We got white asparagus, pork cheek, lamb chop. All tasty."
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,24-Jul-24,5,Tiny Indian restaurant with minimalist menu and eclectic dishes. Amazing small plates.
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,20-Jul-24,4,"I visited solo in early June. Really loved both the broccoli and sea bass - the sauce on the broccoli was incredible. Seabass was light and glistening, not dry at all. The staff mentioned the donut was one of their bestsellers, but it was my least favorite item. It was ground meat covered in potato and shredded vermicelli and fried. I would come back to try more dishes. Superb value for the price.


"
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,4-Jun-24,5,"Made a reservation for a Friday night and had a great meal here. Super tiny space, so definitely recommend booking ahead. My boyfriend and I ordered:

+ Smoked old fashioned cocktail
+ Rasam ke Bomb
+ Porzhi Okra Fries
+ Gunpowder Chaat
+ Spicy venison and vermicelli doughnut
+ Barnsley lamb chop
+ Old monk rum bread and butter pudding

Highlights were the okra fries (so nice I ordered them twice) and the pudding, followed by the Rasam ke Bomb (would order two of those next time because they're small, though they did warn us).

Overall amazing spot!"
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,27-May-24,5,Food and Service were amazing. Wish I was closer and could come here often. Do yourself a favor and try it out!
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,9-May-24,5,"The original Gunpowder where it all began!

The food was incredible! The venison donut, soft shell crab and the aubergine and crispy kale salad were amazing. Small location so be ready for a wait. It was well worth the long wait though. Service was on point. Big fan!"
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,18-Mar-24,5,"This place was highly recommended and it lived up to its standard. The ambiance was astonishing. I made a reservation on Thursday for Saturday at 6:30 pm. Making reservations was easy. We trickled in a bit early the staff were friendly and they were able to seat us quickly. I ordered the gunpowder chaat, egg curry masala, white rice, and kerala beef pepper fry. The food was flavorful it was a good mix of different flavors and spices. The plates are shareable, so we definitely had the right amount of food for two people with a moderate appetite. I ordered a margarita and I was very impressed. My favorite was the gunpowder chaat. When in London, I'll definitely come back and try the other half of the menu.

By the way, Dress casual, perfect for a date night in SoHo!"
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,14-Mar-24,5,"Loved this little place off Commercial St in Whitechapel/Spitalfields. TINY place and there were six of us, so was possibly a no go, but they figured out how to make it work. Was totally worth it.

Would call this elevated Indian fare with a contemporary flare. Intentionally use ""flare"" because some of the dishes are fun and a bit of a surprise, but nothing that jumps the shark. To be honest, some of these dishes were more inventive, more flavorful, and better presented than some of the ""high-end"" Indian places in town (ahem, Kanishka).

Half of us were vegetarian, so we mostly ordered veggie dishes. I am not a vegetarian but would have been 100% satisfied with just those dishes. Kale, aubergine and goat cheese salad - so good we ordered a second batch. Mustard broccoli, egg curry, okra fries, masala dosa - all generous portions and thoroughly satisfying. We also had the softshell crab, sea bass, and venison ""doughnut"" - it was more like a scotch egg, with an spicy chutney that was oh so good. They dont serve bread, but rice was good and also highly recommend the raita, which was almost like a labneh - think and tangy and a great compliment to some of the spicy dishes.

Nice selection of beers and wines by the glass that compliment the food. A highlight of this trip to London - will definitely be back."
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,26-Jan-24,3,"Was here 15 minutes after they opened and with 2 persons already seated they wanted to put us on hold for 90 minutes.

It was recommended by a friend who travels frequently and I did not want to ""name drop"" as it is only slightly more rude than not providing us a table."
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,22-Dec-23,5,"Gunpowder had been on my list for London for a while. This review is for their Greek Street location. We decided to grab dinner here before going to an event at Soho House as it was around the corner. It's a small space but lively. We were seated exactly at the time of our reservation. We made same day reservations just hours before on a Saturday night.

We ordered the ""Festive Vegetarian Feast"" which included:

Gunpowder Chaat. Norfolk. Potatoes (Cannot go wrong with this chaat, delicious!)

Kale, Bhuna Aubergine with Goat Cheese Salad ( I would pass on this if we had the option, fried kale was good & unique but nothing really held the salad together)

Bengali Beet Root Croquettes (these were a favorite, texture and flavor 5/5)

Grilled Artichoke Heart in Red Pepper Masala (THIS was the combination I never knew I needed in my life. Grilled artichoke hearts and masala made a unique combination)

Mustard Malai Broccoli ( Roasted broccoli with a malai curry, I also never thought this combo would go great together until we tried it)

Egg Curry Masala (Delicious, however a bit too spicy for my palate)

Saag with Tandoori Paneer (Thick pieces of tandoori paneer over a bed of classic saag)

Steamed Rice (perfectly cooked basmati rice)

We wrapped up with the Triple Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream and coffee.

This was a LOT of food for 2 people but we wanted to try all the different items. Service was great. They even brought a candle out with the cake as we celebrated a graduation dinner. Would definitely come back next time I'm in London!"
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,11-Oct-23,5,The best Indian food I have. Must try their lamb and shrimps. May need reservations because the place is small and we got lucky for walk in
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,21-Aug-23,5,"Gunpowder is a cozy, little Indian restaurant around Spital Fields. It's so unassuming, you'd never know they were serving such delicious food! I had the Egg Curry Masala and Spicy Venison and Vermicelli Donut. And the bread pudding for dessert was the best part! We also came in 20 minutes before the kitchen closed and still got friendly, attentive (quick) service!"
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,29-Jul-23,5,"A delightfully intimate restaurant serving Indian-inspired cuisine and certainly a contender for one of the best Indian restaurants in London. Between the two of us, we ordered four Small Plates and one Sharing Plate. All dishes contained amazing flavor and spice, with exceptional highlights including the Gunpowder Chaat and the Seabass Paturi Maach (steamed mustard fish).

Service is quite attentive and friendly here - the space is small anyway, with the restaurant seating a maximum of 20 people. It can get pretty cozy, so perhaps not a suitable place for groups of more than 4, but a wonderful spot for date night."
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,23-May-23,5,Crazy good food. The service was also excellent. The vermicelli doughnut is a must try.
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,7-Feb-23,4,"Tiny little spot serving elevated Indian cuisine! Everything is small shareable plates, so be sure you come ready to order several things to pass. The dishes can comfortable be be split between 2, but for larger groups you'll want to order and extra of each item.

Standout items for me were the tandoori chicken chop, porzhi okra fries, and mustard sea bass. Each item has a distinct pop of flavor. The only piece I didn't enjoy was the rum bread pudding - might be better with the extra shot of rum they offer.

We rocked up at 8:30 and they had a few tables for two available for walk ins; however, it was a Monday night so I'd make a reservation if you're set on dining here. There's only about 15 small tables in general. Service is quick and efficient, with all of the food arriving within 15-20 minutes. Things did slow down at the end, if they always made sure we had anything we needed.


"
Gunpowder Spitalfields,Bib,13-Jan-23,5,"Amazing food, friendly attentive service and lovely vibe. Can't recommend this spot enough!"
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,27-May-24,4,"Overall, had a nice dinner here and would recommend trying it if you have a few days in London.

The ambience itself is a bit crowded packed with tables upon tables and there seemed to be one main waiter, so the service was a bit slow. The drinks are well-priced and the wine was pretty good, so that made up for it.

- Celery salt & quail eggs: hard to maneuver but so worth it. So creamy & delicious
- Welsh rarebit: this was the most recommended and was fine. Not the most spectacular fried cheese dish I've had
- Snails & oakleaf: I rather enjoyed this but probably wouldn't be that special to everyone. The snail meat was plentiful and tasty
- Crispy pig's skin: a nice interval between the other dishes. Well done
- Deviled crab: I am inherently opposed to dining experiences that involve digging crab meat out of shells. The meat was well seasoned but the experience of breaking everything apart in the butter was just not worth it. Everyone seemed to have gotten this, so maybe I'm alone in this opinion
- Braised mutton: This was good. The portion was larger than I expected and a nice way to end the meal.
- Added on peas & trotter as a side-dish. A huge portion of peas but a nice accompaniment to the mains"
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,24-May-24,4,"Solid 4.5 stars

Uniquely inventive tasty food that is not fussy. Everything we tried was delicious. Madeleines, Welsh rarebit and Shetland beef and mash were standout.

Simple buzzing atmosphere, plain tables and decor. Unfussy but comfortable.

Service was hit and miss. Our waitress forgot a few things and had to be asked again which is never nice. We ordered negronis and food at the same. Drinks came out when we were already halfway done with first dish"
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,16-May-24,5,"Longer review to follow. Definitely lives up to their long term reputation for perfecting simple, brilliant British cuisine. Be sure to get whatever is recommended. Best chicken liver toast I ever eaten, served alongside brandied prune and cornichons.
"
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,12-Sep-23,2,"I wanted to love this place, I really did. Eating at a St. John establishment has been on my bucket list forever since watching Bourdain do a segment with Fergus Henderson back in the day with bone marrow on toast and black pudding with eggs. I was on business with colleagues and able to score a reservation within walking distance of our billet. It was to be my last (and hopefully best) meal while abroad and I figured I saved the best for last.

It is an attractive space nestled next to Spitalfields Market, quite near to some historic Jack the Ripper sights. This means that you are surrounded by a lot of people out to have a good time and spend some money. Walking in, I got the first sense that we might be in for a long night. Initially there was a nice sense of hurriedness in the kitchen and the floor staff were really hustling to get food to the tables. After a few minutes of watching this with no one coming to greet us, it got a little awkward. So we waited and eventually a server told us someone would get to us. It did not appear that there was a dedicated host and I noted about 4 waitstaff, a manager, and a expediter in chef whites all running food out to tables. In between, they often went into the kitchen to try to help put items together and even cleaning dishware at one point. It seemed like they were either people down or the kitchen was really deep in the weeds. I had a great view of the kitchen though and the dedicated cooks seemed to be keeping their cool.

It was also very loud. I think it was because it was compact with maybe 50 people dining and the acoustics were terrible. As it got busier, it got so loud every time the servers would come to speak with us, we had to ask them to repeat several times because we simply could not hear them at normal speaking distances and volumes above the background din.

I can overlook acoustics since some of that has to do with the old-age design charm of the building. Since it's really about the food, how was it? Good, old-school inventive (meaning it really does use some interesting cuts in a snout to tail kind of way) by dressing things up but salty. My table mates and I love salt and even we thought a few of the items crossed the line. It was great to order some things that one really can't find often such as chicken hearts and pork skin. But some of the fun was removed when the chicken hearts came out on once-crispy toast drowning in jus so it was just a soggy mess. Tasted good but was just a salty, gummy dish. We ate the hearts and left the toast. For my money, the star of the show was the lamb hearts with green sauce and mint. Perfectly seared rare, sliced thin and any gaminess was dealt with by the acidic, herbal sauce. That was a fantastic dish.

Here comes the bad part: Our 4 starters and a bottle of wine came out quickly and we polished those off, and then the wait started. About 20 min in, we got 1 of the larger dishes (consider them to be more like mains) and another about 10 min later. About 60 min after that we had not received the other 2 and no one came to even check on us. Food was flying out to other tables and at one point, I did see a billow of smoke come out of an oven and wondered if it was our partridge burning and maybe in need of a do-over. We became so jet-lagged and tired of waiting that at about 75 minutes of waiting with no new food and no one checking on us, I asked them to simply cancel the rest and bring us the bill. The manager came over and told us that the partridge was already being done and would be out shortly and I got the sense that she was pleading with us to stay so we did. I felt bad and did not want them to have to waste a partridge or eat the cost. She asked me if there was anything she could do to make the situation right. I never suggest a discount under these circumstances because I feel bad doing that. I understand they are having a tough night but I wish she would have suggested it or simply just done it. Or done something, anything as a token of compensation. She knew we were not happy and she acknowledged that it was a delay on their end but she did not really make it right. After another 10-15 min, the partridge came out which was ok but forgettable and we canceled the sweetbreads since they had never shown up.

They brought our check, charged us full bore, thanked us for coming in and let us leave which was disappointing because I will not make the effort to repeat. There are so many great spots to eat in London and this one seems like it used to be one of them but I'm not so sure any longer and since I don't get to London often, I'm not going to chance it. My disclaimer here is that I don't like to give harsh reviews and I have only been here once. This may have been a very off night for them and judging by most other reviews, that would seem to be the case so I hope this review is simply from the once in a million table that did not enjoy itself here on this particular evening."
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,13-Jun-23,3,"The atmosphere and staff were pretty nice. We were 4 people and we went there for lunch. They provided some ""nose to tail eating"" which was nice but the taste was pretty average. The sea bass was good though. Overall I was a bit disappointed by the not-so-impressive food. I felt it was a little overpriced and overrated as well."
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,9-Jan-23,2,"Ate here with family and friends over Christmas. Yuk. This is not head to tail cuisine, it is head and tail cuisine. There were no prime cuts of meat to be found anywhere on the menu; only the cuts that people were forced to eat 100 years ago, because they had to sell the better parts of the animal in order to survive. Now wealthy people pay top dollar to see how poor people ate. Anyone appreciate the irony here? If you are a fan of this restaurant, probably not. There is a perfectly sustainable way use these heretofore unwanted parts of the animal-dog food. It is not necessary for humans to consume them.
To be fair, many of the desserts were excellent. St. John's excels at baked goods and has a lovely, small bakery in Neal's yard which is well worth the visit. Thank goodness that both rich and poor alike had equal access to the basic ingredients necessary to make bread and other bakery items. Otherwise who knows what this hipster hoax of a restaurant would be serving as desert."
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,13-Oct-22,5,"I'm wowed! We made a reservation and were seated promptly. The style of this place is to order dishes to share, and this is what we did! We got the smoked mackerel, turbot, oxtail, and eccles cake to share amongst two people. The mackerel was mindblowing! The smoked flavor was strong, and the fish was nice and salty. There were tons of small bones, so you have to be careful eating it! The turbot was so tender and flaky, and the butter made it extra tasty. The oxtail was also tender and fell off the bone. The eccles cake (pastry with fruit filling inside) was unique and interesting, especially with the cheese. Overall, I really enjoyed the dinner!"
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,9-Oct-22,4,"On a recent visit to London, we enjoyed St. John's innovative, ingredient-driven approach to British food.

Smoked cod roe on toast with egg was very tasty, but slightly overwhelming at the end due to its size and texture. A combination of soft farm cheese and grilled green onions were unique, bitter, and delicious.

Cold pork salad was fine but not a standout dish.

Of the savoury dishes, the best may have been the simple combination of Welsh rarebit with gloriously buttered peas. I would eat that for dinner every day of the week.

You will not regret getting dessert.

On the downside, St. John's seems to go out of its way to obscure and complicate. Over half the dishes on the menu were incomprehensible due to the use of rare varietal names for ingredients such as pork and cheese. My preference is that a 15 minute conversation with the server not be necessary just to order.

Service was perfectly adequate, but not overly warm or welcoming.

The wine and cocktail menu were both wonderful, with many options at all price points. I enjoyed a negroni with a touch of fernet to start the meal, which was unique and delicious.

Overall, a fantastic meal."
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,21-Jul-22,4,"Excellent service and rustic dishes

Came here as a tourist and felt like this was hip place all the locals went to! Our waiter was attentive and helped us pick dishes since we were not totally familiar with everything.

I think the dishes were a little too rustic for us. There was a lot of raw cauliflower, the sardines were a little too bony and salty, and the beef tongue was a little too adventurous. Really wanted to like it!"
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,20-Jun-22,4,"Classic British Food

While most people think of fish and chips when thinking of British food, it encompasses many more dishes of both baked, cured, and oven-varieties

St. John Restaurant is often recommended as representing traditional British fare and their convenient Bread and Wine location at Spitalfields Market is an easy stop after browsing all the great market goods

The menu changes daily and we sampled a variety of classics from braised beef and mash to a welsh rarebit and several types of cured fish

The prep here is top notch and the flavors are more diverse than the bland British food you might find at a tourist stop: worth a stop to sample real British fare

Smoked Cod's Roe, Egg, and Cress £10.80 / Anchovy, Boiled Egg and Mayonnaise £11.10 / Welsh Rarebit (hot cheese sauce over toasted bread) £9 / Smoked Mackerel and Pickled Cucumber £10.10 / Braised Beef and Mash £22.90 / Greens (Cabbage with salt and oil) £5.60 / Bloody Mary £8.50 / Bread and Butter

St. John Bread and Wine (London, United Kingdom)

St. John accepts credit cards and is indoor dining only."
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,12-May-22,5,"I had very high expectations and it lived up to them.
As snack I shared an anchovy toast which was perfect to start with. Then, as entrée I had a salad of lamb's offal with chicory and anchovy which was really good and well seasoned. As main I had grilled ox heart that was perfectly cooked, it was really tender. Madeleines are perfect to finish, soft and not too sweet.

Service is also good and attentive and wine is great. Given quality and quite good portions, prices are completely fair."
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,7-May-22,5,Really great restaurant. Very friendly staff and great food. We just dropped in for drinks and dessert but plan to come back for dinner. The fresh baked madeleines were our favorite. The negronis were amazing drinks. We also really enjoyed our bread and butter pudding with clotted cream and the twice baked chocolate cake.
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,23-Apr-22,5,"This was by far the best restaurant we visited while in London. We tried lots of different plates including ox tongue, boiled ham, and cold mutton. Our favorite was the chicken liver on toast. Even our very picky 14 year ate the food. Which is high praise for her."
St. JOHN Bread and Wine,Bib,17-Jan-22,1,"It was my first night in London so I was extremely excited to go out and try a restaurant that has such great reviews on this app. But I have NEVER had such a terrible experience at a restaurant in my whole life. The waitress I had was so beyond rude to me. She offended me, basically saying it was embarrassing I couldn't afford to buy more food at the place when I was full, she overcharged us for something she convinced us was free, and lastly she rushed us the whole time. Overall, I have never encountered such bad service. I will never step a foot back into this place and I recommend you don't either if you sit down and see your waitress is a woman with black hair, bangs, and the most unwelcoming face I have ever seen. I wish I got her name."
Smokestak,Bib,29-Jun-24,5,"So good. Really. Competition bbq quality brisket and pulled pork. With super yummy bbq sauce (ask for extra). Sausage was also excellent and pork belly was good but a bit tough and over sauced.

Excellent sticky toffee pudding as well.

Super cool vibe and fast, friendly service. Even were excellent over email when I had to change a reservation.

Nice kitchen in the dining room setup as well with great outside tables."
Smokestak,Bib,15-Jun-24,5,"amazing food, we had brisket, salad and sitcky toffe pudding. amazong service food was amazing, american style bbq with a uk flair"
Smokestak,Bib,18-May-24,5,"YES! I was a bit skeptical of BBQ in the UK having been to many BBQ places in the southern USA. But gotta stay, it was all delicious. We got maybe four different meats, double order of fries/chips, drinks, it was all really good.

I did get a bit confused with what the waitress was saying at times but it is what it is - this was a fun place that everyone should try. (Also, if you're wondering if you're at the front door but not quite sure, you're probably at the right place.)"
Smokestak,Bib,14-Oct-23,5,"We've been noticing that barbeque is on the rise in London, and we ventured out while staying in Shoreditch to see for ourselves. Our journey landed us here on a pretty chilly night with a bit of a cue since we had no rezzie. It was completely worth the wait. The crispy ox cheeks, charred pork belly, and the 30-day dry rubbed rib were all a smoky, meaty, delectable experience! Top it off with the Sticky Toffee Pudding with clotted ice cream, and you are talking one tasty meal. We will be back for sure!!!!"
Smokestak,Bib,29-Jul-23,5,"Incredible barbecue -- and I say this having eaten my fair share of barbecue in Texas. The smoky aroma can be smelled from more than a block away as you turn left from Brick Lane, and it's alluring.

I visited with a friend for a weekday lunch, where it was moderately busy but not too crowded.

The pork belly rib is unmissable: a deep, smoky char only attainable after hours in the smoker, melt-in-your-mouth texture, and a slightly sweet glaze that balanced the richness.

The other dishes we ordered too were wonderful: the ox cheek croquettes, gochujang wings, coal roasted aubergine, and broccoli salad. I was surprised the gochujang wings were as tasty and tender as they were; I wouldn't have expected a barbecue restaurants to execute well on Korean fried chicken but it was delightful. The vegetables were a welcome respite and counterbalance to the fattiness of the meal (an interesting and perhaps even preferable contrast to the pickles, onions, and slaw from Texas).

I'll have to try the brisket and beef rib on another visit."
Smokestak,Bib,4-Jul-23,5,"This place is great! Pork belly rib, fennel salad, crispy ox cheek and brisket were all delicious! I'm sure everything is. Great vibe and reasonable prices as well! Would definitely recommend and will be back."
Smokestak,Bib,13-Jun-23,4,"The staff was friendly. We were 5 people sharing and the portion was quite good. My favorite was pork ribs, beetroot and bone marrow. I wouldn't recommend gochujang chicken wings though. I didn't expect much before coming but I had a great time and great foods here. The atmosphere was quite relaxing as well."
Smokestak,Bib,22-Jan-23,5,"Fantastic barbecue (coming from an American) in East London. The atmosphere was crowded and hip. While the food was great, there was also a layer of subtlety and depth you usually don't get in BBQ. Starters were both fantastic: perfectly smoked pastrami and incredible oxtail croquettes. Shared three mains, with the brisket being my favorite. Pork rib had great flavor (one large rib rather than a rack) while the lamb sausage was good but not as mind altering. Red cabbage was red cabbage but the burnt greens were one of the best sides I've had anywhere."
Smokestak,Bib,28-Sep-22,4,"Solid 4.5 stars!

Delicious food and good service. We came in as a large group after a work event. The order was prearranged and all went smoothly. Everything we tried was delicious. The beet salad was excellent, brisket was meltingly perfect and sticky toffee pudding outstanding!

Try the Lucky's Syrah/Pinot Noir, goes well with everything!

Definitely recommend"
Smokestak,Bib,9-May-22,5,"This place was great!! Best barbecue in London. I got the pulled pork sandwich which was one of the best I've ever had. Also got the fries and a house made lemonade. Will be back!!

Kateh,Bib,23-Jan-24,5,"Wow, a Michelin starred place where you could get away with an appetizer, entree and drink for under $100!

First, make a reservation! This spot is on OpenTable and it is pretty small. I was not planning on visiting this spot, mostly because it was in Little Venice and outside most of my places in London, but somehow I lucked out and got a table downstairs.

Second, the food here is delicious. It's truly some of the best Persian food I've ever had. I would recommend ordering family style, just so you get the full experience.

Third, the service is so wonderful and attentive. My server checked on me often and had really wonderful recommendations."
Hereford Road,Bib,1-Sep-23,5,"Beautiful ambiance to go with the delicious food. Great service. Overall, thoroughly enjoyed our dinner. My duck was full of flavor."
Hereford Road,Bib,27-May-23,4,"I enjoyed the braised duck leg with carrots and smoked cod roe salad. The duck had a nice crispy skin and soft meat. The smoked cod roe salad was pleasantly surprising too, not overly dressed!

The service was good; the waiters always made sure our water cups were filled.

Ambiance was lovely, we got seated underneath the moon roof. Overall, an acceptable choice for a meal spot."
