# Sentiment Analysis of Michelin Restaurants
### Michelin-Guide Restaurants vs Public Opinion in London

This project analyzes **881 Yelp reviews** from **58 Michelin-starred and Bib Gourmand restaurants** to evaluate whether **Michelin awards reflect what diners truly value**.

It is a portfolio-oriented version of my **MSc Data Science** dissertation (University of Sheffield, 2024), redesigned for clarity, reproducibility, and technical demonstration.

## Project Overview
I conducted a full data science workflow:
- Data Collection from Michelin Guide & Yelp
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (text cleaning, tokenisation, lemmatisation)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (restaurant-level + review-level patterns)
- Sentiment Analysis using VADER
- N-gram keyword analysis to understand positive/negative language
- Statistical comparison across Michelin categories & price levels
- Visual storytelling to interpret differences between expert ratings and public sentiment

This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world text data, apply NLP techniques, and translate them into meaningful insights.
