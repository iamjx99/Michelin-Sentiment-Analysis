# Sentiment Analysis of Michelin Restaurants
### Michelin-Guide Restaurants vs Public Opinion in London

This repository presents a concise, portfolio-oriented version of my **MSc Data Science** dissertation (University of Sheffield, 2024).
While the full dissertation contains comprehensive academic detail, this edition focuses on clarity, reproducibility, and practical demonstration of data science techniques.

The project is motivated by a central question:
> **Do Michelin awards truly reflect what diners value?**

Using publicly available data from the **Michelin Guide** and **Yelp**, this study examines how expert evaluations compare with public sentiment in London’s dining scene.

The analysis covers **881 Yelp reviews** across **58 Michelin-starred and Bib Gourmand restaurants**, enabling a structured comparison of customer satisfaction and perceived value.

This project applies:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Sentiment Analysis
- Statistical Modelling
- Topic Modelling

to uncover how diners perceive food quality, service, pricing, and overall experience relative to their Michelin recognition.

This portfolio highlights:
- Essential methodology
- Key findings
- Analytical insights
- Important visualisations

in a clear and accessible format suitable for review by recruiters, interviewers, and technical audiences.

## 01_Introduction
The Michelin Guide has long represented expert-driven evaluations based on strict and highly standardised criteria. In contrast, modern platforms like Yelp reflect the experiences of everyday diners, who value not only culinary technique but also service, atmosphere, and overall affordability.

In a city like London, where Michelin-starred and Bib Gourmand restaurants coexist with thousands of public reviews, these two perspectives often highlight different aspects of restaurant quality.

This contrast sets the foundation for examining how expert recognition aligns with public sentiment, and it directly motivates the key objectives and hypotheses of this study.

### 🎯 Research Design: Objectives, Questions, and Hypotheses
To analyse how expert recognition aligns with public sentiment, the study adopts a structured, top-down research design. The process begins with the overarching question of whether Michelin awards reflect what diners truly value. From this starting point, the problem is divided into three core objectives: assessing satisfaction, comparing categories, and identifying the drivers of sentiment.

Each objective is then translated into a concrete research question, ensuring that the analysis remains specific and measurable. Finally, each research question is supported by one or more hypotheses that can be validated through statistical testing and NLP techniques such as sentiment scoring and topic modelling.

The full mapping is summarised below:

| Objective | Research Question(s) | Hypotheses |
|----------|-----------------------|------------|
| **O1. Customer satisfaction** | **RQ1:** Are customers satisfied with Michelin-recognised restaurants? | **H1–H3** |
| **O2. Category & price differences** | **RQ2:** Does higher price correlate with higher satisfaction?<br>**RQ3:** How do Bib Gourmand and Michelin-starred restaurants differ in public sentiment? | **H4–H9** |
| **O3. Linguistic and thematic drivers** | **RQ4:** Which words, topics, or themes shape positive and negative sentiment? | **H10–H12** |

This structured design ensures that every analytical step—whether statistical testing, sentiment analysis, or topic modelling—directly contributes to answering the central question introduced at the beginning of the study.
