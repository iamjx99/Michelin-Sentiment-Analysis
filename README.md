# Sentiment Analysis of Michelin Restaurants
### Michelin-Guide Restaurants vs Public Opinion in London

This project analyzes **881 Yelp reviews** from **58 Michelin-starred and Bib Gourmand restaurants** to evaluate whether **Michelin awards truly reflect what diners value**.

It is a portfolio-ready adaptation of my **MSc Data Science** dissertation (University of Sheffield, 2024), rebuilt with a clean analytical workflow and reproducible code.

For the complete research design, hypotheses, and full methodology, please refer to **[DETAILS.md](DETAILS.md)**.

## Key Findings
- Bib Gourmand restaurants receive higher Yelp ratings than Michelin-starred restaurants (4.49 vs 4.24).
- Higher prices do not improve satisfaction — price level has no correlation with sentiment and a negative correlation with ratings.
- Sentiment and rating are strongly aligned (r = 0.56), confirming text-based sentiment reliably reflects satisfaction.
- Diners’ negative reviews consistently mention service, waiting time, and value for money, regardless of star level.
- Michelin stars signify excellence in cuisine, but do not guarantee a better overall dining experience from the customer’s point of view.

## Conclusions
- **Michelin awards and customer sentiment do not fully align.**
- Diners care less about “culinary technique” and more about **service, value, and experience**.
- Bib Gourmand restaurants — often cheaper — offer **higher perceived value**, which strongly influences satisfaction.
- Michelin-starred restaurants deliver exceptional food but face **higher expectations**, which can lead to lower perceived satisfaction.

This study shows how combining **text analytics**, **sentiment modelling**, and **statistical testing** can reveal insight beyond traditional ratings.
